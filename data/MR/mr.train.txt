1 ||| brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
0 ||| the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
0 |||  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
1 ||| so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is . 
1 ||| this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
1 ||| secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
1 ||| there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
0 ||| a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
1 ||| charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
0 ||| russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
1 ||| it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
1 ||| this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
0 ||| put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
0 ||| doesn't add up to much . 
1 ||| a modest masterpiece . 
1 ||| far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 
1 ||| [d]espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing . . . 
1 ||| almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 
1 ||| adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
0 ||| insufferably naive . 
1 ||| my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
1 ||| here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
1 ||| it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
1 ||| we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher . 
1 ||| a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
1 ||| without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions . 
0 ||| a dreary movie . 
1 ||| the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
1 ||| haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . 
0 ||| the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
1 ||| my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
0 |||  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
1 ||| it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn . 
0 ||| whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
1 ||| what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
1 ||| this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
0 ||| features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
0 ||| watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
1 ||| the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
1 ||| a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
1 ||| very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
1 |||  . . . a true delight . 
0 ||| just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
0 ||| like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . 
0 ||| a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
0 ||| nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
1 ||| the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
0 ||| i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
0 ||| the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
0 ||| [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
0 ||| definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
0 ||| show me the mugging . 
0 ||| disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
0 ||| it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
1 |||  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
0 ||| everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
1 ||| hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 
0 ||| when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
1 ||| it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
1 ||| broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
1 ||| vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
1 ||| lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
0 ||| there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
0 ||| for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
0 ||| viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
1 ||| a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
1 ||| an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
1 ||| it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
1 ||| this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem . 
0 ||| no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
1 ||| 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
0 ||| it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
0 ||| there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
1 ||| swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
0 ||| a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
0 ||| just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
0 ||| leaks treacle from every pore . 
0 ||| equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
0 ||| it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
1 ||| a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride . 
0 ||| despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
0 ||| the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
1 ||| all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
0 ||| an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
0 ||| feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
1 ||| terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
0 ||| its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
1 ||| a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
0 ||| to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
1 ||| ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card . 
0 ||| a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
1 ||| it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
0 ||| may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
0 ||| not so much farcical as sour . 
0 ||| parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
0 ||| rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
0 ||| upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
0 ||| 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
0 ||| the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
1 ||| the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
0 ||| this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
0 ||| it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
1 ||| a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling . 
1 ||| i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
1 ||| over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
0 ||| the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
1 ||| the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
0 ||| the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
0 ||| this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
0 ||| initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
0 ||| the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
1 ||| at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . 
1 ||| filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
1 ||| it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 
0 ||| blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
1 ||| what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
1 ||| it's a count for our times . 
1 ||| ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
0 ||| this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
1 ||| director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
0 ||| parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
1 ||| this new time machine is hardly perfect� yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
0 ||| there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
1 ||| going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . 
0 ||| couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
0 ||| it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
1 ||| not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
1 ||| the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 
1 ||| people cinema at its finest . 
0 ||| the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
0 ||| the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
1 ||| vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
1 ||| extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
0 ||| there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
1 ||| what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
0 ||| not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
1 ||| the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
0 ||| has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
1 ||| ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
0 ||| while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
0 ||| a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
1 ||| the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
0 ||| woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
0 ||| resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
1 ||| heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
1 ||| a muted freak-out
0 ||| it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
1 ||| with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
1 ||| an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief . 
1 ||| i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 
1 ||| the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
1 ||| a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
0 ||| the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
1 ||| the movie is a trove of delights . 
1 ||| more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
1 ||| the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
1 ||| ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
0 ||| i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
0 ||| the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
0 ||| slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
1 ||| beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
0 ||| a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
1 ||| missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
1 ||| what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . 
1 ||| a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script . 
0 ||| charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
1 ||| there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
0 ||| wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
1 ||| in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
0 ||| what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
0 ||| the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
1 ||| delightfully rendered
1 ||| its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 
1 ||| chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
1 ||| argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
1 ||| stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
0 ||| earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
0 ||| not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
1 ||| there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
1 ||| like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
0 ||| a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
1 ||| ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
0 ||| the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
1 ||| scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
1 ||| this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
0 ||| this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
0 ||| so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
1 ||| happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it . 
0 ||| it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
1 ||| every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
1 ||| shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
0 |||  . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
0 ||| louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
0 ||| the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
1 ||| it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
1 ||| though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years . 
1 ||| parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into bu�uel's casings
0 ||| it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
0 ||| a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
1 ||| while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
0 ||| all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
0 ||| nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
0 ||| all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
1 ||| preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
1 ||| every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
0 ||| i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
0 ||| if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
0 ||| derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
1 ||| a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
1 ||| rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
1 ||| the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
1 ||| a funny film . 
1 ||| michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
1 ||| when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
1 ||| uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
0 ||| despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
1 ||| interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
1 ||| by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
1 ||| human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 
0 ||| the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
1 ||| the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
1 ||| the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
0 ||| a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
1 ||| in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby . 
1 ||| like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
0 ||| it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons � a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
1 ||| the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
0 ||| the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
1 ||| it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style . 
1 ||| a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
0 ||| eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
0 ||| be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards . 
0 ||| half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
0 ||| so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
0 ||| a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
0 ||| this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
1 ||| from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
1 ||| unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of�emotional recovery . 
1 ||| a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
1 ||| gloriously straight from the vagina . 
1 ||| the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . 
1 ||| the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . 
1 ||| a small movie with a big impact . 
0 |||  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
0 ||| mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
1 ||| real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
1 ||| maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
0 ||| you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
0 ||| matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
1 ||| a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
0 ||| an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
1 ||| [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
1 ||| austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
1 ||| [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
0 ||| a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
0 ||| a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
0 ||| oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
0 ||| too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
1 ||| not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
1 ||| troubling and powerful . 
1 ||| my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
1 ||| as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
1 ||| if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . 
0 ||| it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
1 ||| it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
0 ||| a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
1 ||| highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . 
1 ||| the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
1 ||| this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
1 ||| one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him . 
1 ||| may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
1 ||| the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
0 ||| feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
1 ||| no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
0 ||| stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here� . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
0 ||| respons�vel direto pelo fracasso 'art�stico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox n�o consegue sequer aproveitar os pouqu�ssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
0 ||| problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
0 ||| director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
1 ||| it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
0 ||| the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
1 ||| cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
1 ||| anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
0 ||| seriously , rent the disney version . 
1 |||  . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 
1 ||| if you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like 'masterpiece theatre' type costumes , you'll enjoy this movie . 
0 ||| makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
0 ||| reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
0 ||| bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
0 ||| a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
1 ||| the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
0 |||  . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
1 ||| a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
1 ||| what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary . but it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain . 
0 ||| mildly amusing . 
1 ||| one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
0 ||| slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
1 ||| overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . 
0 ||| what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
1 ||| a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
1 ||| a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
1 ||| me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
0 ||| the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
1 ||| fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox's work . 
0 ||| adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
0 ||| a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
0 ||| this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
0 ||| a clich�d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
0 ||| it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
1 ||| andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
0 ||| though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
1 ||| an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
1 ||| rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
1 ||| the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
0 ||| it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
1 ||| gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
0 ||| john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
0 ||| the pool drowned me in boredom . 
0 ||| this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
1 ||| while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
0 ||| the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
1 ||| as unseemly as its title suggests . 
0 ||| this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
1 ||| foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
1 ||| a worthwhile way to spend two hours . 
0 ||| there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
1 ||| a masterpiece four years in the making . 
0 ||| this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
0 ||| philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
0 ||| in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
0 ||| none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
0 ||| a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
1 ||| this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
1 ||| in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
0 ||| our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
1 ||| this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . 
1 ||| cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
1 ||| peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
1 ||| smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 
1 ||| the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
0 ||| director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
1 ||| the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
1 ||| it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
0 ||| i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
0 ||| halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
0 ||| you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
1 ||| corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
0 ||| an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
1 ||| its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
1 ||| [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
1 ||| director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve . 
1 ||| this is a superior horror flick . 
0 ||| the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
1 ||| the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
1 ||| a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching . 
1 ||| it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
0 ||| maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
1 ||| a melancholy , emotional film . 
0 ||| takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
1 ||| rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
0 ||| a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
0 ||| if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
0 ||| none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
1 ||| insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
0 ||| the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful . 
1 ||| the film grows on you . and how . 
0 ||| an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
1 ||| a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
0 ||| the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
0 ||| with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
1 ||| the best film of the year 2002 . 
1 ||| the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent . 
1 ||| unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
0 ||| a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
0 ||| banal and predictable . 
1 ||| beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
1 ||| for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
0 |||  . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
0 ||| [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
1 ||| sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing . 
1 ||| the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
1 ||| wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
0 |||  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
0 ||| according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
1 ||| more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
0 ||| about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
1 ||| by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
1 ||| an original little film about one young woman's education . 
0 ||| an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
1 ||| a dazzling dream of a documentary . 
1 ||| it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
0 ||| the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
0 ||| alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
1 ||| psychologically revealing . 
1 ||| no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
1 ||| heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter n�ss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
0 ||| one long string of cliches . 
1 ||| this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
1 ||| if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film . 
0 ||| for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
1 ||| tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . 
0 ||| if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
1 ||| a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
0 ||| with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
0 ||| a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
0 ||| a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
1 ||| the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
0 ||| the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
1 ||| 'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
0 ||| oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
1 ||| it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
0 ||| fairly run-of-the-mill . 
0 ||| it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
1 ||| one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
0 ||| the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
1 ||| director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
0 ||| scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
1 ||| better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
0 ||| a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
0 ||| no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
1 ||| both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
0 ||| bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
1 ||| drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
1 ||| in his u . s . debut , mr . schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist . 
1 ||| red dragon " never cuts corners . 
0 ||| it's just not very smart . 
1 ||| world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
1 ||| the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
0 ||| the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
1 ||| 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
0 ||| another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
0 ||| this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
0 ||| this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
0 ||| this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
0 ||| we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
0 ||| an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
1 ||| its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
1 ||| much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
1 ||| an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama . 
0 ||| what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
0 ||| reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
1 ||| spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
0 ||| a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
1 ||| the dramatic crisis doesn't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience . 
0 ||| while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
0 ||| two-bit potboiler . 
1 ||| the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
1 ||| it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
1 ||| the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . 
1 ||| intriguing and stylish . 
0 ||| a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
0 ||| involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
0 ||| starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich�s . 
1 ||| a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
0 ||| the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
0 ||| they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
0 ||| cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
0 ||| it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
0 ||| it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
0 ||| amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . " 
1 ||| reminiscent of alfred hitchcock's thrillers , most of the scary parts in 'signs' occur while waiting for things to happen . 
0 ||| a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
1 ||| the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
0 ||| dreary tale of middle-class angst
0 ||| lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
0 ||| chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
0 ||| producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
0 ||| a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
1 ||| an unflinching look at the world's dispossessed . 
1 ||| more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
0 ||| seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
1 ||| you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 
1 ||| this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
1 ||| mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
0 ||| because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
0 ||| it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clich�s the filmmakers could dredge up . 
1 ||| a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted . 
0 ||| while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
1 ||| a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
1 ||| [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
0 ||| the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
1 ||| abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 
1 ||| the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
1 ||| an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
0 ||| serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
0 ||| the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
1 ||| the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
1 ||| just how these families interact may surprise you . 
0 ||| those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
1 ||| it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
0 ||| not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
1 ||| only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony . hopkins . 
0 ||| to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
0 ||| bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
1 ||| emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one . 
0 ||| the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
0 ||| the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
1 ||| i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
1 ||| a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama . 
0 ||| equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
0 ||| the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
0 ||| a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
1 ||| like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
0 ||| little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
1 ||| a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
1 ||| an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
1 ||| the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
1 ||| it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
1 ||| duvall is strong as always . 
1 ||| this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
0 ||| a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
1 ||| there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
0 ||| writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
1 ||| tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 
0 ||| watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
1 ||| offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
1 ||| while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
1 ||| tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
0 ||| a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
1 ||| mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 
0 ||| the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
1 ||| an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
0 ||| it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
0 ||| moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
1 ||| hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 
1 ||| a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
1 ||| soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
0 ||| each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
0 ||| the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
0 ||| if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
0 ||| it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
0 ||| it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
0 ||| verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
0 ||| whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
0 ||| the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
0 ||| there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
0 ||| there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
1 ||| combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
0 ||| a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
1 ||| 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
0 ||| a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
0 ||| thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
0 ||| a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
0 ||| aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
0 ||| contrived pastiche of caper clich�s . 
1 ||| an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
0 ||| barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
0 ||| though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
0 ||| whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
0 ||| even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
0 ||| a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
0 ||| bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
1 ||| at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
1 ||| the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . 
0 ||| let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
0 ||| this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
0 ||| wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
0 ||| even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
1 ||| shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
1 ||| the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
1 ||| a compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother's hold over her . 
1 ||| the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
1 ||| the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
0 ||| a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
0 ||| needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
0 ||| there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
1 ||| director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 
0 ||| trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
0 ||| the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
1 ||| the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
1 ||| a model of what films like this should be like . 
1 ||| longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 
1 ||| decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
1 ||| a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
0 ||| hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
0 ||| circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
1 ||| passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
0 ||| the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
1 ||| [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
0 ||| this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
0 ||| stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text � when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
0 ||| it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
0 ||| boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
0 ||| this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
1 ||| at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
1 ||| [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
1 ||| the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
1 ||| miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
1 ||| made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
1 ||| windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
0 ||| it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
1 ||| an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
1 ||| i have a new favorite musical -- and i'm not even a fan of the genre
1 ||| great character interaction . 
1 ||| even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
1 ||| what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .

1 ||| maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
1 ||| most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
1 ||| suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
0 ||| the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
1 |||  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
1 ||| a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
1 ||| light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat . 
1 ||| a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
1 ||| a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
0 |||  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
0 ||| [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
0 ||| smothered by its own solemnity . 
0 ||| [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
0 ||| just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
1 ||| pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 
1 ||| it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
1 ||| not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
1 ||| makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
0 ||| its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
0 ||| if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
1 ||| thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
0 ||| demands too much of most viewers . 
0 ||| it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
1 ||| jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
0 ||| an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
0 ||| why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
1 ||| the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
0 ||| not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
0 ||| it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
0 ||| just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
1 ||| effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
1 ||| an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone . 
0 ||| odd and weird . 
1 ||| much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
1 ||| a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
1 ||| a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . 
0 ||| impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
0 ||| each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
1 ||| worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
0 ||| it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
1 ||| a charming but slight comedy . 
1 ||| i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
1 ||| the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on . 
1 ||| like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
0 |||  . . . they missed the boat . 
0 ||| soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
1 ||| a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . 
1 ||| the hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame . 
0 ||| filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
1 ||| a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
1 ||| though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
1 ||| gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
0 ||| nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
1 ||| 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
0 ||| i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
1 ||| watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
1 ||| this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned . 
0 ||| with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
0 ||| these characters become wearisome . 
0 ||| what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
0 ||| aan opportunity wasted . 
0 ||| being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
1 ||| for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
0 ||| its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda . 
0 |||  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
0 ||| not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
1 ||| impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
0 ||| with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
1 ||| like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . 
0 ||| the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
1 ||| a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events . 
1 ||| director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims . 
1 ||| meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
1 ||| stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
1 ||| the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
0 ||| a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
0 ||| plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
1 ||| that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
0 ||| this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
0 ||| without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
1 ||| it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
0 ||| a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
1 ||| i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
0 ||| it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
0 ||| there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
0 ||| i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
1 ||| while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current . 
0 ||| highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
0 ||| kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
0 |||  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
1 ||| the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
0 ||| even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
0 ||| a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
0 ||| the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
0 ||| audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
1 ||| you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
0 ||| even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
0 ||| narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
1 ||| the film oozes craft . 
0 ||| an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
1 ||| the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
1 ||| tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
0 ||| a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
1 ||| allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
0 ||| an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
1 ||| long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean . 
0 ||| a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
0 ||| a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
0 ||| [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
0 |||  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
0 ||| a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
0 ||| degenerates into hogwash . 
1 ||| hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
1 ||| is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief . 
0 ||| burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
0 ||| i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
1 ||| a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
0 ||| the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
1 ||| it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right . 
0 ||| i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
0 ||| the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
0 ||| content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
1 ||| bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 
1 ||| while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
1 ||| the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
0 ||| i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem�it's supposed to be a drama . 
0 ||| van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
0 ||| [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
0 ||| i hated every minute of it . 
0 ||| brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
1 ||| the fast runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
1 ||| it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
1 ||| a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . 
0 ||| it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
0 ||| fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
0 ||| formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
1 ||| the film has several strong performances . 
1 ||| it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
1 ||| there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
1 ||| a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
1 ||| a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it . 
1 |||  " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography . 
1 |||  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
1 ||| with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
0 ||| disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
1 ||| you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored . . . audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter . 
0 |||  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
0 ||| a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
1 ||| worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
0 ||| guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
1 ||| an hour and a half of joyful solo performance . 
1 ||| the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
0 ||| a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
1 ||| 'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del cl�sico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '
0 ||| the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
1 ||| among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
1 ||| a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
0 ||| burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
1 |||  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
1 |||  . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
1 ||| read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love . 
1 ||| darkly funny and frequently insightful . 
0 ||| this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
0 ||| it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
1 ||| it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
1 ||| a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
0 |||  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
1 ||| veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 
1 ||| it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
1 ||| as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
1 ||| diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
1 ||| you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
0 ||| there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
1 ||| think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
0 ||| though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
1 ||| one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
1 ||| filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
0 ||| the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
0 ||| [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
0 ||| any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
0 ||| a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
1 ||| an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
0 ||| so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
1 ||| photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
0 ||| the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
0 ||| yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
1 ||| throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
1 ||| the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
1 ||| from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right . 
1 ||| beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
0 ||| has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 � weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
0 ||| a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
0 ||| it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
0 ||| the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
0 ||| an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
1 ||| a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
1 ||| clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
1 ||| benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
0 ||| this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
1 ||| a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation . 
0 ||| from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
1 ||| a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
0 ||| in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
0 ||| for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .

1 |||  . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
1 ||| a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 
1 ||| while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
1 ||| rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
1 ||| jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
0 ||| the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
1 ||| the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 
1 ||| while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
1 ||| measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
0 ||| a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
1 ||| cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky's diaries . 
1 ||| just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .

1 |||  " cremaster 3 " should come with the warning " for serious film buffs only ! " 
0 ||| innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
0 ||| first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
1 ||| it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
1 ||| in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
1 ||| nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
0 ||| slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
0 ||| extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
0 ||| like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
1 ||| a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
1 ||| what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
1 ||| huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
1 ||| it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
1 ||| ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
1 ||| if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
0 ||| do not see this film . 
0 ||| mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
0 ||| a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
0 ||| only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
1 ||| more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
0 ||| the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
0 ||| try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
0 ||| in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
1 ||| while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
1 ||| strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
0 ||| any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
1 ||| it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death . 
1 ||| a well-executed spy-thriller . 
0 ||| there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
0 ||| though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
0 |||  . . . too dull to enjoy . 
0 ||| an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
0 ||| britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
1 ||| bon app�tit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation . 
1 ||| an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
0 ||| it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
1 ||| what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
0 ||| the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
0 ||| it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
0 ||| wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
1 ||| a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . 
0 ||| the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
0 ||| in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
1 ||| literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
1 ||| a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . 
1 ||| it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
0 ||| l�stima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
0 ||| one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
1 ||| you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
0 ||| the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
1 ||| e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
0 ||| what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
0 ||| a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
1 ||| broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
0 ||| has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
0 ||| boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
1 ||| kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
0 ||| the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
0 ||| nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clich�s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
1 ||| from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
0 ||| yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
1 ||| the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
1 ||| pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
1 ||| salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
1 ||| shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 
0 ||| a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
0 ||| walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
1 ||| by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable . 
1 ||| funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic . 
1 ||| sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
1 ||| i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
1 |||  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
1 ||| deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
1 ||| you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
1 ||| [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
0 ||| the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
0 ||| it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
0 ||| egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
1 ||| a wildly funny prison caper . 
0 ||| a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
1 ||| an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
1 ||| 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
1 ||| there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
1 ||| a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian . . . life . 
1 |||  " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
0 ||| worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
1 ||| the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
1 ||| this is not a retread of " dead poets' society . " 
1 ||| it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
0 ||| no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
1 ||| like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
1 ||| if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit . 
1 ||| an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 
1 ||| enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
0 ||| feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
1 ||| rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
0 ||| an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
1 ||| the film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod . 
1 ||| maguire is a surprisingly effective peter/spider-man . 
1 ||| eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
1 ||| even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
0 ||| however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
1 ||| in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
1 ||| it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
1 ||| so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
0 ||| the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
0 ||| might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
0 ||| mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
1 ||| somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
0 ||| the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
0 ||| despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
1 ||| despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 
1 ||| kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . 
0 ||| slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
0 ||| the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
1 ||| there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
0 ||| vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
0 ||| oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
0 ||| shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
1 ||| this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . 
0 ||| is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
0 ||| dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
1 ||| this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
1 ||| it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
0 ||| essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
0 ||| shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
0 ||| the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
0 ||| some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
1 ||| the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 
0 |||  . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
0 ||| more precious than perspicacious
0 ||| horrible
0 ||| a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
0 ||| the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
0 ||| the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
1 ||| lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
0 ||| the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
0 ||| somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional . 
0 ||| i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
1 ||| the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . 
1 ||| do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
0 ||| it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
1 ||| there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
0 ||| the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
0 ||| your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
0 ||| with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
0 ||| no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
1 ||| some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
0 ||| a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
1 ||| ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
1 ||| the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
0 ||| the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
1 ||| it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
1 ||| what makes the movie work � to an admittedly limited extent � is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
0 ||| ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
1 ||| mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
0 ||| for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
1 ||| this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
0 |||  . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
0 ||| it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
1 ||| it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
1 ||| a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke . 
0 ||| too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
0 ||| in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
1 ||| brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
0 ||| interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
0 ||| time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
0 ||| ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
0 ||| the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
0 ||| the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
1 ||| eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
1 ||| shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
0 ||| while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
0 ||| ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
1 ||| much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
0 ||| full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
1 ||| while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
1 ||| it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
1 ||| a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
1 ||| a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
1 ||| how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
0 ||| has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
0 ||| drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
0 ||| the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
1 ||| kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
0 ||| to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
0 ||| tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
0 ||| a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
0 ||| an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
0 ||| shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
1 ||| the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
0 ||| gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful clich� in the book at this nonsensical story . 
1 ||| a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
0 ||| one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
0 ||| by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
1 ||| there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
0 ||| such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
1 ||| as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
1 ||| easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
0 ||| the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
1 ||| if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
1 |||  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
0 ||| �the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
1 ||| not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
0 ||| godawful boring slug of a movie . 
1 ||| this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
1 ||| a chilling movie without oppressive gore . 
0 ||| unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
0 ||| an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
1 ||| a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
1 ||| a deep and meaningful film . 
1 |||  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
1 ||| as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
1 ||| cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
0 ||| ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
1 ||| a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
1 ||| colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
0 ||| beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
0 ||| the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
0 ||| a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
1 ||| the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
1 ||| plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
1 ||| remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 
0 ||| the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
0 ||| this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
0 ||| feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
0 ||| all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
0 ||| in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
0 ||| even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
0 ||| the movie gets muted and routine . 
0 ||| aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
1 ||| brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
0 ||| a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
1 ||| it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
1 ||| cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
0 ||| a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
1 ||| maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad . 
0 ||| a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
1 ||| there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
1 ||| the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
1 ||| though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
1 ||| garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
1 ||| real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
0 ||| i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
0 ||| children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
1 ||| as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
1 ||| jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
0 ||| there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
0 ||| cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
0 ||| it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
1 ||| an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
1 ||| it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
1 ||| these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
1 ||| in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
1 ||| what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
0 ||| it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
0 |||  . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
0 ||| it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
1 ||| a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
0 ||| there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
0 ||| 'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
1 ||| a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
0 ||| the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
0 ||| there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
1 ||| in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
0 ||| a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
1 ||| this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times . 
0 ||| a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
0 ||| stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
0 ||| a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
1 ||| until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
0 ||| behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
0 ||| adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
1 ||| an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
0 ||| boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
1 ||| all in all , a great party . 
0 ||| [evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
0 ||| you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
0 ||| the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
0 ||| it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
0 ||| haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
1 ||| despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity . 
0 ||| a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
1 ||| 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia f�lmica imposible de olvidar'
1 ||| the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
0 ||| the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
1 ||| drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
1 ||| an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race . 
1 ||| though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
1 ||| ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
0 ||| ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
1 ||| as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 
1 ||| spare but quietly effective retelling . 
0 ||| flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
1 ||| 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
1 ||| well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
0 ||| never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
0 ||| contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
1 ||| ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
1 ||| a smart , witty follow-up . 
1 ||| an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
0 ||| a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
0 ||| it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
0 ||| the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
1 ||| everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing . 
1 ||| highly engaging . 
0 ||| jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
1 ||| part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
1 ||| very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
0 ||| my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
0 ||| cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
0 ||| an opportunity missed . 
0 ||| the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
0 ||| to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
0 ||| takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
1 ||| it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . 
1 ||| an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
1 ||| its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
0 ||| that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
0 ||| bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
0 ||| has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
0 ||| most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
1 ||| effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
0 ||| alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
0 ||| like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
0 ||| this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
0 ||| what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
1 ||| a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
1 ||| superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
1 ||| goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational ! 
0 ||| not exactly the bees knees
0 ||| bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
0 ||| both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
1 ||| a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
0 ||| a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
0 ||| naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
1 ||| what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
0 ||| it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
0 ||| ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
1 ||| blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
0 ||| a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
0 ||| i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 
1 ||| an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
0 ||| confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
1 ||| diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
1 ||| you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
1 ||| the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
1 ||| the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
1 ||| if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time . 
0 ||| nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
1 ||| dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
1 ||| i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
0 ||| you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
0 ||| this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
0 ||| if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
1 ||| a marvel like none you've seen . 
1 ||| s1m0ne's satire is not subtle , but it is effective . it's a quirky , off-beat project . . . . 
1 ||| giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
0 ||| harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
0 ||| it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
0 ||| scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
0 ||| kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
0 ||| [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
1 ||| director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
0 ||| 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
0 ||| a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
0 ||| frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
0 ||| too clever by about nine-tenths . 
0 ||| too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
0 ||| bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
1 ||| visually striking and viscerally repellent . 
0 ||| none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
1 ||| a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy . 
0 ||| are monsters born , or made ? 
0 ||| enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
0 ||| it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
1 ||| as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
0 ||| beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
0 |||  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
0 ||| unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
1 ||| an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
1 ||| smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
1 ||| piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
1 ||| it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
1 ||| the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 
1 ||| there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
1 ||| arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
1 ||| sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
1 ||| a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
1 ||| a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
1 ||| a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
0 ||| lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
0 ||| trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
1 ||| brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as bond in die another day . 
0 ||| the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
0 ||| hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
1 ||| a manically generous christmas vaudeville . 
0 ||| minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
1 ||| a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality . 
0 ||| though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
0 ||| the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
1 ||| returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
0 ||| made by jackasses for jackasses . 
0 ||| staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
1 ||| overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . 
0 ||| [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
0 ||| instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
1 ||| it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs . 
1 ||| an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays . 
0 ||| mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
1 ||| despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
1 ||| a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 
1 ||| holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
0 ||| you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
1 ||| me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
1 ||| merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
1 ||| captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
0 ||| stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
1 ||| run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen . 
0 ||| like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
0 ||| a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
0 |||  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
1 ||| i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
0 |||  . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
1 ||| the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
1 ||| although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
1 ||| 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
0 ||| less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
1 ||| it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
0 ||| director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
1 ||| offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
0 ||| if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
1 ||| nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
1 ||| solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
1 ||| the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates . 
1 ||| seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
1 ||| the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher . 
1 ||| a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
1 ||| no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
0 ||| neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
1 ||| the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
0 ||| the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
0 ||| the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
0 ||| the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
1 ||| nice piece of work . 
1 ||| if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
0 ||| this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
0 ||| an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
0 ||| if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
0 ||| the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
1 ||| the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
0 ||| laughably , irredeemably awful . 
0 ||| a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
0 ||| began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
0 ||| even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
0 ||| visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
0 ||| how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
1 ||| moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
1 ||| a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
1 |||  " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble . 
0 ||| like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
0 ||| the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
0 ||| the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
0 ||| the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
0 ||| an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
0 ||| the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
0 ||| a negligible british comedy . 
0 |||  " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
1 ||| it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
0 ||| another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
1 ||| as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace . 
0 ||| no way i can believe this load of junk . 
1 ||| while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own . 
1 ||| lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
1 ||| starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
1 ||| funny but perilously slight . 
1 ||| a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
0 ||| a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
0 ||| so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
0 ||| human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
0 ||| before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
0 ||| whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
1 ||| we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
1 |||  . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
1 ||| morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
0 ||| 'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
0 ||| although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours . 
1 ||| this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
1 |||  . . . a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life's endgame . 
1 ||| a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion . 
1 ||| a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . 
0 ||| pompous and garbled . 
0 ||| feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
0 ||| this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
1 ||| the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
1 ||| an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
1 ||| it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
0 ||| kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
0 ||| a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
1 ||| it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
0 ||| if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
0 ||| the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
0 ||| the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
1 |||  . . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know . 
1 ||| though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
0 ||| a well-crafted letdown . 
0 ||| overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
0 ||| if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
0 ||| really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
0 ||| as social expos� , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
0 ||| it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
1 |||  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
1 ||| leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
1 ||| elegant and eloquent [meditation] on death and that most elusive of passions , love . 
0 ||| sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
0 ||| feels familiar and tired . 
0 ||| it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
0 ||| an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
1 ||| a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
1 ||| that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
0 ||| shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
0 ||| the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
0 ||| this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
1 ||| ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
1 ||| ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
1 ||| a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
1 ||| some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast . 
0 ||| with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
0 ||| johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
1 ||| the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
1 ||| watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
0 ||| the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
0 ||| downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
0 ||| this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
0 ||| a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
0 ||| yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
0 ||| fluffy and disposible . 
1 ||| a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
1 ||| chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
1 ||| the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
0 ||| rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
1 ||| a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
0 ||| instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
0 ||| eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
1 ||| the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
1 ||| the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
1 ||| fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
0 ||| tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
1 ||| would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
1 ||| you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
1 ||| spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
1 ||| a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . 
0 ||| falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
0 ||| you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
0 ||| it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
0 ||| the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
0 ||| shallow . 
1 ||| more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
0 ||| the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen .

0 ||| rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
0 ||| de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
1 ||| a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
0 ||| this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
0 ||| by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
1 ||| while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , " in the bedroom , " moretti's film makes its own , quieter observations
1 ||| like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
0 ||| the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
0 ||| just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
1 ||| candid camera on methamphetamines . 
1 ||| insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
0 ||| culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
0 ||| however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
1 ||| a comic gem with some serious sparkles . 
0 ||| it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
1 ||| gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
1 ||| miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
1 ||| nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion . 
1 ||| a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history . 
1 ||| contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
1 ||| tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
0 ||| predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
1 ||| a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
1 ||| the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations
0 ||| it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
0 ||| is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
1 ||| handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
0 ||| a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
1 ||| a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
1 ||| mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
0 |||  . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
0 ||| propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
1 ||| a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . 
1 ||| if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
1 ||| it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
0 ||| a processed comedy chop suey . 
0 ||| it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
1 ||| a small gem from belgium . 
0 ||| the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
0 ||| unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
0 ||| purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
0 ||| the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
1 ||| life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
0 ||| one of the worst movies of the year . 
1 ||| although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
1 ||| has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now . 
1 ||| a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles . 
1 ||| the performances are uniformly good . 
0 ||| uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth . 
0 ||| [a] mess . 
1 ||| irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
0 ||| i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
0 ||| what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
1 ||| [cuar�n has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
0 ||| the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
1 ||| manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
0 ||| makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
0 ||| scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
1 ||| the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
1 ||| secretary is just too original to be ignored . 
0 ||| an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
1 ||| if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
0 ||| lazily directed by charles stone iii . . . from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis . 
1 ||| puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman . 
0 ||| it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
0 ||| on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
1 ||| brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
0 ||| a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
1 ||| the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . 
1 ||| as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
1 ||| has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
1 ||| an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
1 ||| the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
0 ||| co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
0 ||| it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
0 ||| better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
0 ||| schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
1 ||| somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
1 |||  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
0 ||| when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
0 ||| a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
0 ||| what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
0 ||| costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
1 ||| it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
0 ||| this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
1 ||| the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
1 ||| often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
0 ||| solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
1 ||| bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
1 ||| this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
0 ||| trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
0 ||| an overstylized , pur�ed m�lange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
1 ||| in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep . 
0 ||| as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
0 ||| though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
1 ||| an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
1 ||| the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
0 |||  . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
1 ||| if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next . 
1 ||| the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
0 ||| the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
0 ||| its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
0 ||| an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
0 ||| it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
1 ||| it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
1 ||| the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 
1 ||| an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . 
0 ||| it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
0 ||| the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
0 ||| the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
1 ||| a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
1 ||| maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
0 ||| it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
1 ||| [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
0 ||| it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
0 ||| dramatically lackluster . 
1 ||| more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
0 ||| the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
1 ||| edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
0 ||| it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
1 ||| thanks to haynes' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act . 
0 ||| a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
0 ||| halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
1 ||| it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works . 
1 ||| greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
1 ||| i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
0 ||| more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
0 ||| directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
1 ||| bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores . 
0 ||| not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
1 ||| in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
0 ||| the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
0 ||| the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
0 ||| visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
0 ||| blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
0 ||| the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
0 ||| it's an awfully derivative story . 
1 ||| many insightful moments . 
1 ||| chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
0 ||| there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
0 ||| a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
0 ||| it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
0 ||| for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
1 ||| try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
0 ||| a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
0 ||| much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
0 ||| busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
1 ||| the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
1 ||| it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
0 ||| such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
1 ||| brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
1 ||| not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
0 ||| there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
1 ||| a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
1 ||| [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
1 ||| it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
0 ||| i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
0 ||| writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
1 ||| i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
1 ||| the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
1 |||  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
1 ||| vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
0 ||| there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
1 ||| an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
0 |||  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
1 ||| borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
1 ||| the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
0 ||| the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
1 ||| as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
1 ||| for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
1 ||| with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
0 ||| the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
1 ||| the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
1 ||| hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department . 
1 ||| essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens . 
1 ||| third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
1 ||| its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . 
0 ||| the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
0 ||| seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
0 ||| no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
0 ||| [a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
0 ||| a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
0 ||| the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
0 ||| the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
0 ||| crummy
1 ||| a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
1 ||| the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system . 
0 ||| no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
0 ||| exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
0 ||| with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
1 ||| the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
1 ||| sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
0 ||| about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
0 |||  . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
0 ||| its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
0 ||| despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
0 ||| some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
0 ||| any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
1 ||| obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
1 ||| turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
0 ||| pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
1 ||| 'aunque recurre a ciertos clich�s del g�nero , la poderosa actuaci�n de robin williams perdona las fallas del gui�n . '

0 ||| contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
0 ||| waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
1 ||| uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . 
0 ||| teen movies have really hit the skids . 
0 ||| its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
1 ||| chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original . 
0 ||| trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
1 ||| star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
0 ||| trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
1 ||| efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug . 
1 ||| the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
0 ||| observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
0 ||| tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple � he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
1 ||| majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
0 ||| it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
1 ||| while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . 
1 ||| [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
0 ||| trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
0 ||| ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
0 ||| national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
0 ||| movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
1 ||| an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
0 ||| holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
0 ||| for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
1 |||  . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
1 ||| a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child . 
1 ||| if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . 
0 ||| this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
0 ||| this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
0 ||| anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
1 ||| an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 . 
1 ||| the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
0 ||| bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
1 ||| the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
0 ||| a sour , nasty offering . 
0 ||| instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
1 ||| try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
0 ||| static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
1 ||| though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
1 ||| n�s gosta muito de as duas torres . 
0 ||| miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
1 ||| on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
1 ||| a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
1 ||| the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
1 ||| for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
0 ||| though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
0 ||| what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
1 ||| funny and touching . 
0 ||| the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
0 ||| the ch�teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
0 ||| there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
1 ||| a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . 
0 ||| you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
1 ||| what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
1 ||| while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
1 ||| in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
0 ||| it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
0 ||| the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
1 ||| light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically . 
0 ||| the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
0 ||| an ugly , revolting movie . 
1 ||| this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
1 ||| a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
1 ||| a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
0 ||| kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
0 ||| yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
0 ||| ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
1 ||| lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
1 ||| a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
0 ||| here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
0 ||| now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
0 ||| occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
0 ||| a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
0 ||| weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
0 ||| there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
0 ||| taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
0 ||| the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
1 ||| tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
1 ||| both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
0 ||| it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
0 ||| the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
1 ||| hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . 
1 ||| there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
1 |||  . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
1 ||| miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary . 
0 ||| the movie bounces all over the map . 
1 ||| got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
1 ||| the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
1 ||| koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation . 
0 ||| i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
1 ||| the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
0 ||| it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
0 ||| a sometimes tedious film . 
1 ||| moving and vibrant . 
0 ||| it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
1 ||| el t�tulo no enga�a : la pel�cula narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentar� cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 
1 ||| the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
0 ||| it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
0 ||| i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
1 ||| beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
1 ||| a tone poem of transgression . 
0 ||| an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
0 ||| it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
0 |||  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
1 ||| well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
1 ||| effective but too-tepid biopic
1 ||| reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 
1 ||| an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
0 ||| a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
0 ||| it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
0 ||| rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
1 ||| a fun ride . 
1 ||| there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him . 
1 ||| george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
0 ||| the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
0 ||| viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
1 ||| a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation . 
1 ||| entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
1 ||| it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
0 ||| at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
1 ||| much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
1 ||| it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
1 ||| the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
0 ||| despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
1 ||| in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters � damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
0 ||| rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
0 ||| if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
0 ||| a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
1 ||| a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
0 ||| once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
1 ||| exciting and well-paced . 
0 ||| the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
0 ||| blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
1 ||| it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
0 ||| it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
0 ||| super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
1 ||| this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
1 ||| demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
1 ||| overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances . 
1 ||| occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
1 ||| the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
0 ||| too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
0 ||| a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
1 ||| by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
0 ||| the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
1 ||| fun and nimble . 
1 ||| alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
0 ||| may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
0 ||| while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
1 ||| the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable . 
1 ||| about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
0 ||| feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
0 ||| an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
0 ||| what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
0 ||| for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
1 ||| you'll end up moved . 
0 ||| deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
0 ||| madonna still can't act a lick . 
0 ||| broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
0 ||| the film is like sitting in a downtown caf� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
0 ||| there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
0 ||| a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
1 ||| a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
0 ||| the script ? please . 
0 ||| true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
1 ||| lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
0 ||| this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
1 ||| remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it . 
0 ||| it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
1 ||| an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
1 |||  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
0 ||| starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
1 ||| a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
0 ||| instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
1 ||| [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
0 ||| please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
1 ||| looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
0 ||| [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow . 
0 ||| how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
1 ||| williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
1 ||| whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
1 ||| although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
0 ||| mildly entertaining . 
0 ||| oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
1 ||| for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
0 ||| this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
0 ||| davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
0 ||| it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
0 ||| hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
0 ||| it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
1 ||| the movie is well done , but slow . 
0 ||| a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
1 ||| a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
1 |||  . . . there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen . 
0 ||| more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
1 ||| it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
0 ||| the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects . 
0 ||| dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
0 ||| almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
1 ||| it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
1 ||| a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
0 ||| calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
1 ||| very predictable but still entertaining
1 ||| the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
1 ||| if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
0 ||| mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
1 ||| whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting . 
0 ||| even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
0 ||| the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
1 ||| this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
0 ||| there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
0 ||| if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
0 ||| an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
1 ||| will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
0 ||| nothing about it fits . 
1 ||| has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
1 ||| unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
1 ||| this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive . 
1 ||| a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
0 ||| opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
1 ||| as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
1 ||| even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
1 ||| o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . 
1 ||| in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
0 ||| juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
1 ||| jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers . 
1 ||| everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 
0 ||| enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
1 ||| mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
0 ||| returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
0 ||| sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
0 ||| it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
0 ||| not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
1 ||| a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
1 ||| you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
1 ||| watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat . 
1 ||| your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 
1 ||| its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
1 ||| director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
0 ||| the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
1 ||| it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout . 
1 ||| a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
0 ||| the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
1 ||| as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
0 ||| there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
0 ||| blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
1 ||| while not quite " shrek " or monsters , inc . " , it's not too bad . it's worth taking the kids to . 
1 ||| much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
0 ||| every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
0 ||| a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
1 ||| one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers . 
1 ||| a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
0 ||| none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
0 ||| solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
0 |||  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
1 ||| scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation . 
0 ||| feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
0 ||| a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
0 ||| flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
0 ||| absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
0 ||| there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
1 ||| hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
0 |||  . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
1 ||| evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
0 ||| under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
0 ||| i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
0 ||| comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man . 
0 ||| a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
1 ||| the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
1 ||| the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
1 ||| a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera . 
0 ||| director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
1 ||| huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
1 ||| will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
0 ||| normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
0 ||| has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
1 |||  . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
1 ||| �an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
1 |||  " me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . 
1 ||| this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
0 ||| never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
0 ||| see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
0 ||| what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
1 ||| the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
0 ||| like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
1 ||| when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . 
1 ||| a marvel of production design . 
1 ||| nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
1 ||| a wonderful , ghastly film . 
1 ||| cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
1 ||| a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . 
0 ||| characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
1 ||| presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
0 ||| this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
0 ||| a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
0 ||| seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
0 ||| the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
0 ||| traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clich�s that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
0 ||| the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
0 ||| although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
1 ||| a solidly entertaining little film . 
1 ||| the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
1 ||| like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
1 ||| at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
1 ||| like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
0 ||| [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
1 ||| it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
1 ||| methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . 
0 ||| the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
1 ||| this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . 
0 ||| a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
1 ||| elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
0 ||| plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
0 ||| its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
1 ||| at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
1 ||| for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
0 ||| the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
1 ||| director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
0 ||| the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
0 |||  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
0 ||| looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
0 ||| to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
1 ||| all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit . 
1 ||| don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
0 ||| one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
0 ||| an often unfunny romp . 
1 ||| a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
0 ||| undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
0 ||| the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
1 ||| what 'dumb and dumber' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script . 
0 ||| with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
0 ||| simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
0 ||| imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
0 ||| one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
0 ||| scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
0 ||| care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
0 ||| everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
0 ||| take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
0 ||| the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
0 ||| did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
1 ||| it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 
1 ||| a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith . 
1 ||| the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority . 
0 ||| any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
0 ||| some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
1 ||| this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
0 ||| who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
0 ||| plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
1 ||| a riveting story well told . 
0 ||| the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
0 ||| it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
1 ||| while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
0 ||| crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
1 ||| the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
1 ||| i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
1 ||| offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere . 
1 ||| even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
1 ||| the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
0 ||| focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
0 ||| terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
0 ||| sluggish , tonally uneven . 
1 ||| while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
0 ||| what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
1 ||| less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself . 
0 ||| decent but dull . 
0 ||| priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
1 ||| directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
1 ||| dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
0 ||| let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
0 ||| most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
1 ||| there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
0 ||| they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
1 ||| moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
1 ||| katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
0 ||| never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
1 ||| the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
0 ||| if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
0 ||| peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
1 ||| ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
1 ||| as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
1 ||| whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
0 ||| nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
0 ||| the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
0 ||| it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
0 ||| like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
0 ||| yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
0 ||| in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 
0 ||| too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
1 ||| a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
0 |||  " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
1 ||| if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
1 ||| despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
0 ||| when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
1 ||| all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
1 ||| an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
1 ||| the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
0 ||| two hours of junk . 
1 ||| you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
0 ||| set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
0 ||| fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
1 ||| with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
1 ||| you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
1 ||| schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
0 ||| none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
1 ||| almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
0 ||| sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
1 ||| woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
1 ||| filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . 
1 ||| a lovely film for the holiday season . 
0 ||| it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
1 ||| this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
1 ||| for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
1 ||| the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
0 ||| gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clich�s . 
0 ||| too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
0 ||| as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
0 ||| nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
0 ||| dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
0 |||  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
1 ||| filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity . 
1 ||| i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
0 ||| the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
1 ||| exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
1 ||| it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
1 ||| the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster . 
0 ||| the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
0 ||| gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
1 ||| leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
0 ||| this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
0 ||| most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
0 ||| you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
0 ||| there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
1 ||| it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
0 ||| completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
0 ||| dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
0 ||| the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
1 ||| though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
1 ||| the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
0 ||| an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
0 ||| bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
0 ||| helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
0 ||| nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
0 ||| the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
0 ||| like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
0 ||| less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
0 ||| though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
0 ||| the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
1 ||| last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
0 ||| the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
0 ||| jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
0 ||| instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
0 ||| her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
0 ||| however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
1 ||| it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters . 
0 ||| the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
0 ||| bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
1 ||| in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
0 |||  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
1 ||| an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
1 ||| it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
1 ||| i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
1 ||| a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
0 ||| entertaining enough , but nothing new
0 ||| the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
0 ||| one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
1 ||| it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
1 ||| young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
0 ||| some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
1 ||| dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny . 
0 ||| you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
0 ||| hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
0 ||| creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
0 ||| good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
1 ||| moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
0 ||| a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
0 ||| to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
1 ||| the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
0 ||| the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
0 ||| here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
1 ||| reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
0 ||| the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
1 ||| it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
1 ||| if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
0 ||| does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
1 ||| polished , well-structured film . 
0 ||| herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
1 ||| more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
1 ||| it makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
0 ||| a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
0 ||| an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
1 ||| a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . 
1 ||| it's like a " big chill " reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists . 
0 ||| the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
0 ||| gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
0 ||| there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clich�d , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
1 ||| those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
0 ||| a lifetime movie about men . 
1 ||| a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
1 ||| it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
1 ||| a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
1 ||| this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
1 ||| the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
1 ||| though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . 
0 ||| the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
1 ||| an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naivet� and sophistication . 
0 ||| this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
0 ||| the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
0 ||| this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
0 ||| broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
0 |||  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
1 ||| fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten
1 ||| what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
0 ||| fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
0 ||| with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
0 ||| a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
0 ||| the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
0 ||| interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
1 ||| the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges . 
1 ||| shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
0 ||| a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
1 ||| it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 
0 ||| has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
1 ||| a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad . 
0 ||| i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
1 ||| an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
1 ||| works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
1 ||| the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
0 ||| wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
0 ||| instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
0 ||| lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
0 ||| there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
1 ||| every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
1 ||| presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation . 
0 ||| at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
0 ||| a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
0 ||| earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
0 ||| julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
1 ||| though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see . 
0 ||| for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
0 ||| suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal . 
1 ||| this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
1 ||| payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
1 ||| i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 
1 ||| a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
1 ||| windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
1 ||| enticing and often funny documentary . 
1 ||| whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
1 ||| an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
0 ||| journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
0 |||  . . . hokey art house pretension . 
0 ||| no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
1 ||| inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
0 ||| the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
0 ||| this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
1 ||| ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with . 
0 ||| a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
0 ||| we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
1 ||| writer and director otar iosseliani's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls . 
0 ||| davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
1 ||| though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
0 ||| a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid cr�me br�l�e . 
1 ||| a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
0 ||| been there done that . 
1 ||| the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
0 ||| despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
0 ||| frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
1 ||| lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 
1 ||| beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
0 ||| more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
1 ||| what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
1 ||| i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
1 ||| too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
1 ||| it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
1 ||| george clooney , in his first directorial effort , presents this utterly ridiculous shaggy dog story as one of the most creative , energetic and original comedies to hit the screen in years . 
1 ||| finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
1 ||| a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
0 ||| prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
0 ||| a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
1 ||| the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
1 ||| those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
0 ||| even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
0 ||| the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 
1 ||| as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . 
1 ||| reassuring , retro uplifter . 
1 ||| de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
1 ||| psychologically savvy . 
0 ||| you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
0 ||| a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
0 ||| the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
0 ||| a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
1 ||| frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
1 ||| audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
1 ||| a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
0 ||| sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
0 ||| a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
1 ||| [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
1 ||| this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
0 ||| for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
0 ||| there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
0 ||| flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
0 ||| thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
1 ||| ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
1 ||| lightweight but appealing . 
1 ||| romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
1 ||| there's a lot to recommend read my lips . 
0 ||| ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
1 ||| provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
0 ||| there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
0 ||| zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
1 ||| a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
0 ||| it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
1 ||| an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy . 
1 ||| this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
1 ||| pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
1 ||| unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
1 ||| the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
1 ||| charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
0 ||| it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
1 |||  . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
0 ||| usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
1 ||| it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
1 ||| caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
1 ||| splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
0 ||| 'the ch�teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
0 ||| it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
1 ||| it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
1 ||| it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
1 ||| once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't , either . 
1 ||| it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
0 ||| there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
1 ||| all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
1 ||| newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
0 ||| director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
1 ||| it's so good that you can practically see the hollywood 'suits' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too -inevitable american remake . 
1 ||| a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
0 ||| coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
1 ||| ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
1 ||| if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
0 ||| well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
0 ||| a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of . 
1 ||| there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
1 ||| nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit . 
1 ||| both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
1 ||| [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
0 ||| a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
1 ||| challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
1 ||| a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
0 ||| the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
1 ||| it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
0 ||| it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
0 ||| except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
1 ||| a smart , compelling drama . 
1 ||| one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
1 ||| this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
0 ||| there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head . 
1 ||| tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience . 
0 ||| a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
0 ||| if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
1 ||| a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't . 
0 ||| instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
1 ||| it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
1 ||| it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
0 ||| you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
0 ||| an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
1 ||| real women have curves doesn't offer any easy answers . 
1 ||| rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
1 ||| like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
1 ||| a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
1 ||| time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
0 ||| impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
1 |||  . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clich�s to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
1 ||| so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
0 |||  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
1 ||| so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
1 ||| one of the funnier movies in town . 
1 ||| flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance . 
1 ||| washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
1 ||| the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
0 ||| doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
1 ||| george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
1 ||| steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes . 
0 ||| 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo m�stico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensaci�n de inconformidad que hace pensar m�s de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
0 ||| it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
1 ||| nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
0 ||| some episodes work , some don't . 
0 ||| like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0 ||| elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
0 ||| like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
1 ||| full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing . 
1 ||| the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
0 ||| i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
1 ||| if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
1 ||| it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
1 ||| one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
1 ||| a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined . 
0 ||| nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
1 ||| the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
0 ||| the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
1 ||| we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
0 ||| make like the title and dodge this one . 
0 ||| consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
0 ||| don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
1 ||| one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years . 
1 ||| stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
1 ||| the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
0 ||| intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
0 ||| it's just rather leaden and dull . 
0 ||| is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
0 ||| one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
1 ||| if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
0 ||| adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
0 ||| apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
1 ||| the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
1 ||| as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
1 ||| [n�s] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
0 ||| comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
0 ||| quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
0 ||| the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
1 ||| rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film's short 90 minutes . 
1 ||| mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
0 |||  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
1 ||| it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
1 ||| a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
1 ||| it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
0 |||  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
0 ||| proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
0 ||| you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
1 ||| worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
1 ||| idiotic and ugly . 
1 ||| the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
0 ||| has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
1 ||| you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
1 ||| pray has really done his subject justice . 
0 ||| something must have been lost in the translation . 
0 ||| george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
1 ||| the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
0 ||| arty gay film . 
1 ||| a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
0 ||| no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
0 ||| fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
1 ||| boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer . 
0 ||| tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
0 ||| with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
1 ||| most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
0 ||| many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
0 ||| the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .

0 ||| a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .

1 ||| for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
1 ||| the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
1 ||| while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest . 
1 ||| they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment .

1 ||| alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
1 ||| easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
1 ||| gently humorous and touching . 
1 ||| as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
1 ||| like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .

1 ||| reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
1 ||| meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
0 ||| it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
0 ||| so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
0 ||| like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
1 ||| though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess . 
1 ||| good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
0 ||| it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
0 ||| this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
1 ||| worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
0 ||| rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .

0 ||| this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
1 ||| highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
1 ||| the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
1 ||| it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
1 ||| a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
1 ||| this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
1 |||  " its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . " 
0 ||| serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
0 ||| makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
0 ||| in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
1 ||| with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h�l�ne angel is definitely a director to watch . 
0 ||| a cockeyed shot all the way . 
1 ||| as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
1 |||  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
0 ||| it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
1 |||  . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
1 ||| often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
0 ||| the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down . 
0 ||| a bad movie that happened to good actors .

1 ||| everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing . 
0 ||| blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
0 ||| a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
1 ||| cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
1 ||| the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
0 ||| no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
1 ||| khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .

1 ||| a charmer from belgium . 
0 ||| an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
0 ||| historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .

1 ||| a . . . cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers . 
0 ||| the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
0 ||| splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
1 ||| the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie . 
1 ||| though jackson doesn't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . 
1 ||| there's an energy to y tu mam� tambi�n . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
0 ||| did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
1 ||| it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
1 ||| jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
1 ||| this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
0 ||| roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .

0 ||| there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
0 ||| sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
1 ||| best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
1 ||| the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . 
1 ||| could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
1 ||| it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
1 ||| an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
0 ||| if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
1 ||| good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
1 ||| if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
1 ||| is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say , yes , 'it's like having an old friend for dinner' . 
1 ||| the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects . 
1 ||| a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 . 
1 ||| serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
0 ||| a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
1 ||| poetic , heartbreaking . 
0 ||| feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
1 ||| good ol' urban legend stuff . 
1 ||| the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . 
1 ||| it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
1 ||| the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
0 ||| it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
1 ||| i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . 
0 ||| the film can depress you about life itself . 
1 ||| not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
0 ||| an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
1 ||| the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
1 ||| a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . 
1 ||| coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
0 ||| i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
1 ||| an intoxicating experience . 
0 ||| morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
1 ||| the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
0 ||| doesn't really add up to much . 
1 ||| grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
1 ||| tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
0 ||| from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
1 ||| depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
1 ||| demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
1 ||| peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . 
0 ||| though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
1 ||| proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
0 ||| that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
0 ||| a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
1 ||| a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
1 ||| it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
1 ||| almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
1 ||| a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
1 ||| maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again . 
1 ||| boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
0 ||| staggeringly dreadful romance . 
0 ||| morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
0 ||| the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
1 ||| rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 
1 ||| there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
0 ||| howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
1 ||| jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
1 ||| the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
0 ||| a collage of clich�s and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
1 ||| were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
1 ||| suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
1 ||| el peso de un l�quido incoloro , el peso del l�quido vital , del amor como elemento de vida , y de muerte . . . 
0 ||| a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
1 ||| audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 
1 ||| in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
1 ||| noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
0 ||| no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
1 ||| delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
1 ||| richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
1 ||| a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
1 ||| russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
0 ||| a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
0 ||| it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
1 ||| one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
1 ||| young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work . 
1 ||| buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 
1 ||| waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
0 ||| the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
0 ||| in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
1 ||| this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
0 ||| stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
1 ||| it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
1 ||| a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
0 ||| the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
1 ||| but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
1 ||| we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
1 ||| campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
1 ||| thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic . 
0 ||| none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
0 ||| it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
1 ||| in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
0 ||| muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
1 ||| the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
0 ||| if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
0 ||| i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
0 ||| was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
1 ||| a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
0 ||| the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
1 ||| the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
1 ||| coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
1 ||| directed with purpose and finesse by england's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
0 ||| the chocolate factory without charlie . 
1 ||| its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
0 ||| clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
0 ||| violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
0 ||| it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
1 ||| using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
0 ||| due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
1 ||| further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
0 ||| meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
0 ||| a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
0 |||  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
1 ||| [scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll . 
1 ||| you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
0 ||| while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
0 |||  " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
1 ||| the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time . 
1 ||| high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
1 ||| a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
1 ||| the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
0 ||| the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
1 ||| a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession � one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
1 ||| a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
1 ||| the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
0 ||| the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
0 ||| this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
0 ||| isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
0 ||| forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
1 ||| when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
0 ||| the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
1 ||| sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
1 ||| colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
0 ||| not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
1 ||| as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
0 ||| too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
1 ||| the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
1 ||| its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray . 
1 ||| a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale . 
1 ||| beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
1 ||| offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
1 ||| director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
1 ||| dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
1 ||| between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
1 ||| it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
1 ||| a joyous occasion
0 ||| competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
0 ||| this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
0 ||| plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
0 ||| in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
1 ||| a good thriller . 
0 ||| this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
0 ||| a half-assed film . 
1 ||| sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
1 ||| it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
0 ||| fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
0 ||| such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
0 ||| another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
1 ||| brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
0 ||| it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
0 ||| the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
0 ||| something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
0 ||| it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
0 ||| the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
0 ||| sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
0 ||| the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
1 ||| so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '
0 ||| it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
0 ||| movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
1 ||| birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . 
0 ||| every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
0 ||| its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
1 ||| that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
0 ||| rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
0 ||| distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
1 ||| the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . 
0 ||| one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
1 ||| [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
0 ||| the action clich�s just pile up . 
0 ||| it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
1 ||| if you like quirky , odd movies and/or the ironic , here's a fun one . 
1 ||| [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
0 ||| rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
1 ||| wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
0 ||| a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
1 ||| if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
1 ||| promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
0 ||| lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
1 ||| it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn . 
1 ||| denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
1 ||| some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . 
0 ||| the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
0 ||| downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
1 ||| succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
0 ||| an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
1 ||| although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
1 ||| the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
0 ||| it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
1 ||| it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
0 ||| hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
0 ||| rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
1 ||| one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
1 ||| it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
0 ||| strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
1 ||| the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
1 ||| a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
0 ||| the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
1 ||| it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
1 ||| captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . " 
1 ||| it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . 
1 ||| contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na mem�ria . 
1 ||| it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
0 ||| uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
0 ||| if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
0 ||| it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
0 ||| no surprises . 
1 ||| throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 
0 ||| it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
0 ||| the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
0 ||| an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
0 ||| no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
0 ||| handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffl� . 
1 ||| a genuine mind-bender . 
1 ||| en s� mismo el rey le�n es un espect�culo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
0 ||| these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
0 ||| the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
1 ||| it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
0 ||| mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
1 ||| like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
0 ||| it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
1 ||| if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . 
0 ||| i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
1 ||| watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
0 ||| mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
1 ||| may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
1 ||| miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
0 ||| you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
0 ||| it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
0 ||| you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
1 ||| there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
1 ||| i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
0 ||| denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
1 ||| even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
0 ||| it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
1 ||| too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience . 
1 ||| brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
0 ||| call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
0 ||| this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
1 ||| mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
1 ||| though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
1 ||| the film truly does rescue [the funk brothers] from motown's shadows . it's about time . 
1 ||| even the digressions are funny . 
1 ||| it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
1 ||| a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
0 ||| time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
0 ||| it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
0 ||| sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
0 ||| the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
1 ||| a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
1 ||| best indie of the year , so far . 
0 ||| what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
1 ||| using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
0 ||| i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
0 ||| the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
1 ||| as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan . 
0 ||| a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
1 ||| devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
0 ||| this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
1 ||| [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
0 ||| it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
0 ||| nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
0 ||| this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
1 ||| it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks . 
0 ||| once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
0 ||| hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
0 ||| this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
0 ||| why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
0 ||| this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
0 ||| as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
1 ||| noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
0 ||| quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
1 ||| pacino is the best he's been in years and keener is marvelous . 
1 ||| apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
1 ||| a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
0 ||| director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
1 ||| may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
0 ||| a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
1 ||| building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . 
1 ||| a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
1 ||| a gem of a movie . 
1 ||| ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier . 
0 ||| lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
0 ||| the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na�vet� and arbitrary flashbacks . 
1 ||| peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments . 
0 ||| disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies�or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
0 ||| the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
1 ||| neatly constructed thriller . 
0 ||| irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
1 ||| the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
0 ||| there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
0 ||| it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
1 |||  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
1 ||| making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
1 ||| the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
0 ||| the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
1 ||| vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
0 ||| believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
0 ||| the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
0 ||| a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
1 ||| it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
0 ||| the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
0 ||| as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
0 ||| even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
0 ||| basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
1 ||| visually captivating . 
0 ||| so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
1 ||| though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
0 ||| uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
0 ||| an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
0 ||| credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
0 ||| it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
0 ||| parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
0 ||| the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
1 ||| visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
1 |||  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
0 ||| feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
1 ||| what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
0 ||| it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
1 ||| crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
1 ||| the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
0 ||| director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
1 |||  ( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind . 
1 ||| for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out . 
1 ||| whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 
1 ||| greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders . 
1 ||| apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
0 ||| although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
0 ||| you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
0 ||| city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
1 ||| birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
1 ||| in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
0 ||| true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
1 ||| a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
1 ||| in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . 
0 ||| the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
1 ||| dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . 
0 ||| there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
1 ||| elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
0 ||| something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
0 ||| you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
1 ||| makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
1 ||| it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
1 ||| the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
0 ||| a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
0 ||| looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
1 ||| merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 
1 |||  . . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observaci�n de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones . 
1 ||| excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
0 ||| wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
1 ||| phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
0 ||| a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
0 ||| both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
0 ||| a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
0 ||| is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
1 ||| disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
1 ||| it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
0 ||| once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
0 ||| there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
0 ||| on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
0 ||| it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
0 ||| the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
0 ||| i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
0 ||| [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
1 ||| captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
1 ||| while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
0 ||| trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
1 ||| displaying about equal amounts of naivet� , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential . 
0 ||| i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
1 ||| this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
1 ||| together [time out and human resources] establish mr . cantet as france's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace . 
0 ||| most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
0 ||| fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
1 ||| the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in . 
0 ||| a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
0 ||| i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
0 ||| and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
0 ||| i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
1 ||| i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise . 
0 ||| this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
1 ||| the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
1 ||| it says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense . 
0 ||| blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
0 ||| this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
0 ||| one lousy movie . 
1 ||| majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times . 
1 ||| a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
0 ||| it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
1 ||| more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
0 ||| drowning's too good for this sucker . 
0 ||| manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
0 ||| this is so bad . 
1 ||| the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
1 ||| it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
0 ||| written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
1 ||| hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
1 ||| a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
0 ||| [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
1 ||| a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride . 
0 ||| a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
1 ||| does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
1 ||| the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
0 ||| we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
1 ||| anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 
1 ||| a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
0 ||| one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
1 ||| the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 
0 ||| this is no " waterboy ! " 
0 ||| the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
0 ||| a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
1 ||| thanks to the ch�teau's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
0 ||| [a] poorly executed comedy . 
1 ||| it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression . 
1 ||| though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
1 ||| shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
0 ||| pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
1 |||  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
0 ||| snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
0 ||| i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
1 ||| if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
1 ||| it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
1 ||| sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
1 ||| a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
1 ||| at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
1 ||| one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory . 
1 ||| nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
0 ||| a sudsy cautionary tale . 
1 ||| the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
1 ||| mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
1 ||| a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
1 ||| it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
0 ||| in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
0 ||| this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
0 ||| high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
0 ||| viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
1 ||| a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 
1 ||| there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
0 ||| uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
0 ||| those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
1 ||| aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil . 
0 ||| it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
1 ||| is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking . 
0 |||  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
1 ||| combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
1 ||| until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
0 ||| not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
1 |||  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
0 ||| the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
0 ||| outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
0 ||| sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
0 ||| just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
0 ||| comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
1 ||| it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
1 ||| even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
1 ||| a conventional but heartwarming tale . 
1 ||| its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
1 ||| resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
0 ||| it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
1 ||| the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
0 ||| queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
0 ||| if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
0 ||| might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
0 ||| feeble comedy . 
0 ||| well , it does go on forever . 
0 ||| though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
0 ||| the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
0 ||| the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
0 ||| there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
0 ||| displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
1 ||| what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
0 ||| an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
1 ||| the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
0 ||| there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
1 ||| it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
1 ||| though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
0 ||| the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
1 ||| the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
1 |||  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
0 ||| i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
1 ||| it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
0 ||| aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
0 ||| this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
1 ||| a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
1 ||| a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
1 ||| the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
0 ||| the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
0 ||| it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
0 ||| offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
1 ||| the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
0 ||| slick piece of cross-promotion . 
1 ||| a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
0 ||| [newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
0 ||| the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
0 ||| leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
0 ||| the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
1 ||| best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
1 ||| blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
0 ||| the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
1 ||| thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . 
0 ||| attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
1 ||| a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
1 ||| at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , " i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . " congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
0 ||| if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
1 ||| the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
0 ||| one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
0 ||| the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
1 ||| it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
0 ||| much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clich� . 
0 ||| its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
0 ||| the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
1 ||| for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 
0 ||| watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
1 ||| although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
0 ||| a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
1 ||| stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
0 ||| vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
0 ||| if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
0 ||| if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
0 ||| guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
1 ||| throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
1 ||| a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
1 ||| while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
1 ||| there is greatness here . 
0 ||| serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
1 ||| it is a likable story , told with competence . 
1 ||| energetic and boldly provocative . 
0 ||| the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
0 ||| all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
1 ||| a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . 
1 ||| this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
0 ||| laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
1 ||| as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
1 ||| the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
0 ||| this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
0 ||| deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
0 ||| this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
0 ||| it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
1 ||| an epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood . 
1 ||| a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
0 ||| the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
1 ||| an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
1 ||| a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
1 ||| as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
0 ||| barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
1 ||| fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
1 ||| hey , who else needs a shower ? 
0 ||| no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
0 ||| this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
1 ||| not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
0 ||| i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
1 |||  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
1 ||| the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
1 ||| less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
0 ||| if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
1 ||| though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
1 ||| not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
0 ||| the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
0 ||| all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
1 ||| the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
1 ||| the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
0 ||| once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
0 ||| feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
1 ||| you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
1 ||| the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
1 ||| texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
0 ||| return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
0 ||| all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
0 ||| as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
0 ||| turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
0 ||| i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
0 ||| the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
1 ||| the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . 
1 ||| its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
0 ||| the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
0 ||| the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
1 ||| though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone . 
0 ||| suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
1 ||| will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them . 
0 ||| the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
0 ||| generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
1 ||| it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . 
0 ||| wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
1 ||| deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame . 
1 ||| devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
0 ||| like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
0 ||| there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
1 ||| one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . 
0 ||| animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
1 ||| an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st . petersburg's hermitage museum . 
0 |||  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
0 ||| there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
0 ||| even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
0 ||| a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
1 ||| the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
1 ||| despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
0 ||| the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
1 ||| mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way . 
0 ||| the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
1 ||| a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy . 
1 ||| for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
1 ||| an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
1 ||| it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 
1 ||| the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
1 ||| allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
0 ||| j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
0 ||| beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
0 ||| by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
1 ||| the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
0 ||| if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
1 ||| the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
0 ||| i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
1 ||| post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
1 ||| an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
0 ||| this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
1 ||| a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
1 ||| old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
0 ||| the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
1 ||| with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar�'s metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
1 ||| lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
1 ||| the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats' perspective . 
1 ||| a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
0 ||| completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
0 ||| the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
0 ||| the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
1 ||| the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
0 ||| god is great , the movie's not . 
1 ||| not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
0 ||| feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
0 ||| director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
1 ||| witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
0 ||| the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
1 ||| rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
1 |||  . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
1 ||| lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
1 ||| an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best . 
1 ||| it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
1 ||| the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
1 ||| an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
1 ||| ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '
1 ||| triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree . 
0 ||| due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
0 ||| it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
0 ||| directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
0 ||| depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
0 ||| while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
1 ||| much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
0 ||| ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
1 ||| kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 
0 ||| it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
0 ||| that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
0 ||| nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
0 ||| but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
0 ||| since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
1 ||| there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
1 ||| i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
1 ||| the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
0 ||| there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
0 ||| an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
1 ||| several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
1 ||| smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
0 ||| it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
0 ||| though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
0 ||| for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
1 ||| a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . 
1 ||| nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
0 ||| credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
0 ||| an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
0 ||| originality is sorely lacking . 
0 |||  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
1 ||| a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
0 ||| it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
0 ||| a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
0 ||| spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
0 ||| one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
0 ||| i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
1 ||| it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
1 ||| originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
1 ||| a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
0 ||| tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
0 ||| so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
0 ||| don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
1 ||| by turns very dark and very funny . 
0 ||| after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich�s , depression and bad alternative music . 
1 ||| ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
0 ||| the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
1 ||| a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . 
0 |||  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0 ||| the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
0 ||| a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
0 ||| even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
0 ||| despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
1 ||| affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
0 ||| tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
0 ||| friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
1 ||| rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
1 ||| there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
0 ||| blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
1 ||| to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr . freud . 
0 ||| there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
1 ||| [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
1 ||| a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
0 ||| utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
0 ||| the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
1 ||| the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
1 ||| it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
0 ||| a noble failure . 
0 ||| despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
0 ||| flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
1 ||| steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
0 ||| in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
1 ||| it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
1 ||| the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster . 
1 ||| leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
1 ||| it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . 
1 ||| impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises . 
0 ||| a relative letdown . 
0 ||| starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
1 ||| a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is . 
1 ||| neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
1 ||| barry convinces us he's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
0 ||| lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
1 ||| like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
1 ||| very well-written and very well-acted . 
1 ||| this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . 
0 ||| it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
1 ||| intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being . 
0 ||| the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
0 ||| despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
0 ||| murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
1 ||| playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
0 ||| whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
0 ||| scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
0 ||| if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
0 ||| men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
1 ||| savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
1 ||| skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 
0 ||| despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
1 ||| moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
1 ||| an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
1 ||| a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
0 ||| not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich� left unsaid . 
1 ||| a slight but sweet film . 
0 ||| the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
0 ||| despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
0 ||| it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
1 ||| both deeply weird and charmingly dear . 
0 ||| though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
1 ||| in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition
1 ||| it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count . 
0 ||| very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
1 ||| the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
0 ||| we get the comedy we settle for . 
0 ||| an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
0 ||| it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
0 ||| the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
0 ||| its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
0 ||| new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
1 ||| droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . " 
0 ||| would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
1 ||| art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
0 ||| the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
1 ||| as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
0 ||| borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
1 ||| [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
1 ||| spiderman rocks
1 ||| that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
1 ||| evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
0 ||| you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
1 ||| ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
1 ||| a worthy entry into a very difficult genre . 
0 ||| 'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
0 ||| the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
1 ||| jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
0 ||| zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
1 ||| it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
0 ||| adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
0 ||| throw smoochy from the train ! 
1 ||| a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
1 ||| a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
1 ||| a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given . 
0 ||| unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
1 ||| it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
1 ||| the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
1 ||| reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
0 ||| the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
0 ||| a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
1 ||| an absurdist spider web . 
1 ||| it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself . 
1 ||| a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every clich� of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
1 ||| the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most . 
1 ||| a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
0 ||| hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
1 ||| while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
1 ||| like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
1 ||| it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
1 ||| frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances . . . keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
0 ||| a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
0 ||| an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
1 ||| another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
0 ||| all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
1 ||| this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
0 ||| [nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
0 ||| a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
1 ||| the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 
0 ||| combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
0 ||| rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
0 ||| the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
1 ||| this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
0 ||| the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
1 ||| provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
1 ||| bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
1 ||| the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away . 
1 ||| wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
1 ||| an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
0 ||| 'this movie sucks . '
0 ||| no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
0 |||  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
0 ||| an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
1 ||| jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma . 
1 ||| one from the heart . 
0 ||| the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
0 ||| a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
0 ||| i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
0 ||| it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
0 ||| i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
0 ||| maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
0 ||| the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
0 ||| this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
0 ||| the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
1 ||| it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
0 ||| kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
1 ||| those of you who don't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original . well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
1 ||| will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
0 ||| one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
0 ||| a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
1 ||| i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
1 ||| most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
1 ||| just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
1 ||| while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
1 ||| there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
0 ||| an awful snooze . 
1 ||| the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
0 ||| the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
0 ||| if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
0 ||| mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
0 ||| a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
1 ||| it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
0 ||| it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
0 ||| it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
0 ||| harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
0 ||| this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
0 ||| this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
1 ||| i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
1 ||| if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
0 ||| serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
1 ||| despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
1 ||| you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here . 
1 ||| here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you . 
0 ||| would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility . 
1 ||| like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
1 ||| the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
0 ||| the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
1 ||| it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
1 ||| polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
1 ||| it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
1 ||| the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
1 ||| compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
1 ||| can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
1 ||| the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
1 |||  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
0 ||| 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
1 ||| a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
1 ||| craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
1 ||| with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
1 ||| [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
0 ||| they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
1 ||| though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
1 ||| enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
1 ||| lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
1 ||| the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
0 ||| this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
1 ||| this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
1 ||| provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz . 
1 ||| one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
1 ||| the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
0 ||| it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
0 ||| largely a for-fans artifact . 
1 ||| perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
1 ||| like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
0 ||| all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
1 ||| jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
1 ||| despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
0 ||| it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
0 ||| sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
0 |||  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
1 ||| as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
1 |||  " white oleander , " the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material . 
1 ||| will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
0 ||| there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
1 ||| an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
1 ||| one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
0 ||| kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
1 |||  . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
0 ||| the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
1 ||| the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
1 ||| more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
0 ||| director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
1 ||| there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
1 ||| a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich�s and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
0 ||| the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
0 ||| the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
1 ||| both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
1 ||| it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
1 ||| elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
1 ||| it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
0 ||| like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
1 ||| coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
0 ||| low rent from frame one . 
0 ||| a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
1 ||| it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
0 ||| throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
1 ||| the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
0 ||| the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
0 |||  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
0 ||| the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
1 ||| a three-hour cinema master class . 
0 ||| every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
1 ||| my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
0 ||| it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
0 ||| with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
0 ||| even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad . 
0 ||| feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .

0 ||| the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
0 ||| not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
1 ||| an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
1 ||| if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea's interpersonal drama , it ain't half-bad . 
0 ||| can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
1 ||| narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
1 ||| it's a very valuable film . . . 
0 ||| shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
1 ||| good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . 
1 ||| in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
1 ||| it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
0 ||| certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
1 ||| what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
1 ||| bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
1 ||| evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
0 ||| i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
1 ||| foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .

0 ||| eh . 
1 ||| performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
1 ||| warm and exotic . 
1 ||| in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
0 ||| hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
1 ||| tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script . 
1 ||| while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
0 ||| imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
0 ||| jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
1 ||| m�nch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
1 ||| overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
1 ||| exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven� [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . 
1 ||| not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
0 ||| this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
1 ||| for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
1 ||| it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
1 ||| [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
0 ||| [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
0 ||| you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
1 ||| director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
0 ||| this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
0 ||| a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
0 ||| the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
1 ||| if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
0 ||| throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
1 ||| a captivating new film . 
0 ||| it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
0 ||| i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
0 ||| if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
1 ||| spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
0 ||| lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
0 ||| in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
0 ||| it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
0 ||| yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
0 ||| jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
1 ||| the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
1 ||| the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
1 ||| if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
1 ||| this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
0 ||| it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag . 
0 ||| adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ?

0 ||| a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
0 |||  " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
0 ||| a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
0 ||| at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
0 ||| while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
1 ||| puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food . 
1 ||| it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 
0 ||| resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
0 ||| we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
1 ||| es una de esas pel�culas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido . 
0 ||| in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
1 ||| despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
0 ||| skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
1 ||| surprisingly powerful and universal . 
1 ||| it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
0 ||| stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
1 ||| you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week . 
1 ||| the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
0 ||| as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
1 ||| this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
1 ||| this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
1 ||| the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . 
1 ||| it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
1 ||| continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
0 ||| mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
1 ||| an enjoyable experience . 
0 ||| this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
0 ||| falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
1 ||| while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
1 ||| visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
1 ||| you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
1 ||| raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
0 ||| suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
1 ||| vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
0 ||| what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
1 ||| if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
1 ||| its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
0 ||| perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
1 ||| she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
0 ||| no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
1 ||| a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
0 ||| a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
1 ||| a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
0 ||| the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
0 ||| trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
1 ||| sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
1 ||| hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
0 ||| an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
1 ||| [cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots . 
0 ||| for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
1 |||  . . . ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters' crises with seriousness and compassion . 
0 ||| you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
0 ||| for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
1 ||| red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
0 ||| i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
0 ||| it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
0 ||| the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
0 ||| a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
1 ||| as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
0 ||| plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
1 ||| it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
1 ||| few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
1 ||| murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . 
0 ||| stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
1 ||| if anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
1 ||| it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . 
1 ||| everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
0 |||  . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
1 ||| matches neorealism's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives . 
0 ||| this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
1 ||| if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
1 ||| the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit . 
0 ||| do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
1 ||| if there's no art here , it's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days . 
1 ||| with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
1 ||| reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
0 ||| the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
0 ||| between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
0 ||| paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
0 ||| cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
1 ||| it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . 
1 ||| armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
1 ||| i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
0 ||| the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
0 ||| [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
0 ||| first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
0 ||| directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
0 ||| green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
0 ||| the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
1 ||| the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
1 ||| an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick .

1 ||| more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
0 ||| all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
1 ||| a true-blue delight . 
0 ||| it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
0 ||| this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
1 ||| audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
1 ||| altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
0 ||| technically and artistically inept . 
1 ||| the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
1 ||| a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
1 ||| as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
1 ||| an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash . 
0 ||| sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
0 ||| chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
0 ||| partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
1 ||| much monkeyfun for all . 
0 ||| the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
0 ||| most of the action setups are incoherent . 
1 ||| entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
1 ||| sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
0 ||| debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
0 ||| the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
1 ||| funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking . 
1 ||| an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
1 ||| one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
1 ||| secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
0 ||| there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
0 ||| this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
0 ||| silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
0 ||| there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
0 ||| bland but harmless . 
0 ||| a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
0 ||| the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
1 ||| a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
0 ||| a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
0 ||| a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
0 ||| no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
1 ||| wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse . 
0 ||| the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
0 ||| presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
1 ||| if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
0 ||| though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
1 ||| it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 
0 ||| a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
1 ||| a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
1 ||| the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
1 ||| the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 
0 ||| cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
1 ||| if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
1 ||| now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 
0 ||| think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
0 ||| a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
1 ||| the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
1 ||| merci pour le movie . 
0 ||| dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
0 |||  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
1 ||| the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
0 ||| initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
0 ||| here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
1 ||| when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve . 
1 ||| it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 
1 ||| 'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
1 ||| birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
1 ||| delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity . 
0 ||| imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
1 ||| 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
0 |||  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
0 ||| at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
1 ||| novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
0 ||| fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
0 ||| mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
0 ||| witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
0 ||| the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
0 ||| has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
1 ||| a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
0 ||| director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
0 ||| forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
0 ||| the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
1 ||| simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
1 ||| a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
1 ||| what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
1 ||| disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
1 ||| here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
1 ||| one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . 
0 ||| possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
1 ||| you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject . 
1 ||| watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
1 ||| all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 
0 ||| writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
0 ||| the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
1 ||| rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
0 ||| stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
1 ||| there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
0 ||| so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
0 ||| sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
0 ||| terrible . 
1 ||| no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
1 ||| in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clich�s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
1 ||| who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
0 ||| one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
0 ||| the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
1 ||| at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
0 ||| if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
1 ||| it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
0 ||| the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
1 ||| unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
0 ||| the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
1 ||| while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
1 ||| will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about . 
0 ||| it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
0 ||| unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
1 ||| the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
1 ||| everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . 
1 ||| it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
0 ||| since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
0 ||| may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
0 ||| just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
1 ||| steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches . 
1 ||| engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched . 
1 ||| it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
1 ||| it's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
1 ||| it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 
0 ||| its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
1 ||| it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
0 ||| this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
1 ||| it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
0 ||| eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
1 ||| a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
0 ||| this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
1 ||| this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
0 ||| a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
0 ||| the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
1 ||| i've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we've got something pretty damn close . 
0 ||| the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
0 ||| any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
0 ||| the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
0 ||| it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
1 ||| a taut , sobering film . 
1 ||| the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
0 ||| the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
0 ||| this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
1 ||| the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
0 ||| it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
0 ||| the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
0 ||| this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
1 ||| it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair . 
1 ||| the film is full of charm . 
1 ||| cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 
1 ||| don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
1 ||| if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is . 
1 ||| morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
0 ||| as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
1 |||  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
0 ||| we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
0 ||| a incompet�ncia de marcus adams como roteirista s� � superada por sua p�ssima dire��o . 
0 ||| the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
0 ||| obvious
1 ||| offers that rare combination of entertainment and education . 
1 ||| these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 
0 ||| [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
0 ||| the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
0 ||| there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
1 ||| spielberg's realization of a near-future america is masterful . this makes minority report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever . 
0 ||| fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
0 ||| from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
1 ||| a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
1 ||| a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
0 ||| brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
1 ||| pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism . 
1 ||| one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 
1 ||| carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
1 ||| first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
0 ||| it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
0 ||| it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
1 ||| even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
1 ||| a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
1 ||| the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 
1 ||| like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
0 ||| although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
0 ||| the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
1 |||  " it's all about the image . " 
1 ||| what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
1 ||| escapism in its purest form . 
1 ||| seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
0 ||| doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
1 ||| writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
1 ||| its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
0 ||| accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
0 ||| toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
1 ||| absorbing character study by andr� turpin . 
1 ||| even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
1 ||| if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
0 ||| the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
0 ||| in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
0 ||| the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
0 ||| frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
1 |||  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
0 ||| [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
1 ||| 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
1 ||| insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
1 ||| the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
0 ||| there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
1 ||| rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
1 ||| earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing . 
0 ||| if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
0 ||| beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
0 ||| what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
1 ||| the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking because you get it . 
1 ||| for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
1 ||| ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a exist�ncia de papai noel era um fato inquestion�vel . 
1 ||| it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
1 ||| it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
1 ||| not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
1 ||| while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
0 ||| nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
1 |||  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
1 |||  . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
1 ||| the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
0 ||| little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
1 ||| the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
1 ||| a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . 
1 ||| a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
1 ||| nothing is sacred in this gut-buster . 
0 ||| while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
0 ||| when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
1 ||| steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
1 ||| trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
1 ||| one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature . 
0 ||| makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
0 ||| the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
0 ||| just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
1 ||| if you love reading and/or poetry , then by all means check it out . you'll probably love it . 
0 ||| girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
1 |||  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
1 ||| a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
1 ||| worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
0 ||| i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
1 ||| an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
0 ||| about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
0 ||| how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
0 ||| a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
0 ||| this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
0 ||| attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
0 ||| the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
1 ||| it's still adam sandler , and it's not little nicky . and for many of us , that's good enough . 
0 ||| can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
1 ||| the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary . 
0 ||| comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
0 ||| the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
1 ||| k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
1 ||| a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . 
0 ||| there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
0 ||| a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
1 ||| renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
0 ||| this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
0 ||| bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
0 ||| woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
0 ||| topkapi this is not . 
1 ||| if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
1 ||| there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
1 ||| while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
0 ||| we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
0 ||| nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
1 ||| able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
0 ||| the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
0 ||| more trifle than triumph . 
0 ||| as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
0 ||| [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
1 ||| it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
0 ||| fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
1 ||| a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
1 ||| there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
1 ||| adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
1 ||| one of the best of a growing strain of daring films . . . that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect . 
0 ||| an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
1 ||| an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale . 
1 ||| the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
0 ||| how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [fran�ois and mich�le's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
0 ||| [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
0 ||| plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
1 ||| what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
0 ||| my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
0 ||| de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
1 ||| the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
1 ||| while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
1 ||| a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . 
0 ||| begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
0 ||| puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
1 ||| arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
0 ||| it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
0 ||| romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
0 ||| the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
0 ||| i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
1 ||| a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
0 ||| the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
0 ||| looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
1 ||| call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity . 
0 ||| a real snooze . 
1 ||| the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . 
0 ||| it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
1 ||| the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
0 ||| it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
1 ||| children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
0 ||| a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
0 ||| almost gags on its own gore . 
1 ||| a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
0 ||| should have been someone else-
0 ||| both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
1 ||| an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
1 ||| there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay's portrait of grief . 
1 ||| less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
0 ||| de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
1 ||| much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
0 ||| the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
1 ||| whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
0 ||| the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
0 ||| even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
0 ||| largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
0 ||| nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
0 ||| some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
0 ||| tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
1 ||| byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
1 ||| in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
0 ||| narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
1 ||| muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
0 ||| it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
0 ||| the film is flat . 
1 ||| streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , " big trouble " is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . 
0 ||| for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
1 ||| a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
0 ||| does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
1 ||| what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
1 ||| many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
1 ||| garc�a bernal and talanc�n are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
1 ||| a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
0 ||| grating and tedious . 
0 ||| needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
1 ||| ' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
0 ||| it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
0 ||| harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
1 ||| my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
1 ||| there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
1 ||| most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
0 ||| a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
0 ||| as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
0 ||| [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
0 ||| the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
0 ||| el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
0 ||| a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
0 ||| there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
1 ||| ferrara's best film in years . 
1 ||| watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . 
1 ||| a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience . 
0 ||| just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
1 ||| the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 
1 ||| while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . 
0 ||| well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
0 ||| a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
1 ||| it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
1 ||| for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
0 ||| the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
0 ||| this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
1 |||  . . . it's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
1 ||| succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
1 ||| catch it . . . if you can ! 
1 ||| like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . 
0 ||| if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
0 ||| it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
0 ||| rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
0 ||| self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
1 ||| as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
1 ||| a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
1 ||| a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . 
1 ||| the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
1 ||| in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
1 ||| for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
1 |||  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
0 ||| contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
1 ||| one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
1 ||| add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
1 ||| francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
0 ||| you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
0 ||| although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
1 |||  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
1 ||| a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
0 ||| once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . 
0 ||| simplistic , silly and tedious . 
0 ||| [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
0 ||| most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
0 ||| a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
0 ||| no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
1 ||| a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
1 ||| they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
1 |||  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
1 ||| special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
0 ||| watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
0 ||| amazingly lame . 
1 ||| all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
0 ||| not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
1 ||| a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
1 ||| more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
0 |||  " freaky friday , " it's not . 
0 ||| despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
1 ||| twenty years after its first release , e . t . remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg's misunderstood career . 
1 ||| it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
0 ||| i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
1 ||| while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
1 ||| a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
1 ||| this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
0 ||| an extremely unpleasant film . 
1 |||  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
1 ||| huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
0 ||| this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
1 ||| the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
0 ||| spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
0 ||| it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
0 ||| for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
1 ||| it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
1 ||| the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
1 ||| hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
0 ||| some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
0 ||| a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
1 ||| feral and uncomfortable . 
1 ||| a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
0 ||| schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
0 ||| as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
0 ||| director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
0 ||| the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
1 ||| in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
0 ||| mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
0 ||| harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
1 ||| it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
0 ||| everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
0 ||| the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1 ||| i couldn't recommend this film more . 
0 |||  . . . hypnotically dull . 
1 ||| take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
1 ||| the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
0 ||| if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
0 ||| a quaint , romanticized rendering . 
1 ||| about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
1 ||| a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
0 ||| too much power , not enough puff . 
1 ||| [broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue . 
1 |||  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
1 ||| one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
1 ||| it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
0 ||| gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
0 ||| fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
1 ||| if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
1 ||| the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
0 ||| the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
0 ||| worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
1 ||| it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
0 ||| it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
0 ||| eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
1 ||| the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
0 ||| the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
1 ||| though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking . 
0 ||| it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
1 ||| a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
0 ||| lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
0 ||| an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
0 ||| there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
0 ||| no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continua��o , harold ramis deve ter sa�do da cama com o p� esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme tamb�m . 
0 ||| astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
0 ||| while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
1 ||| occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almod�var style . 
1 ||| the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
1 ||| often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
0 ||| este � apenas mais um ( longo ) epis�dio do programa da mtv . a �nica diferen�a � que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
0 ||| just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
1 ||| kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
1 ||| as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
1 ||| all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
0 ||| a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
1 ||| eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
1 ||| at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center . 
0 ||| too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
0 ||| a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
0 ||| it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
1 ||| this is one of polanski's best films . 
1 ||| there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
1 ||| this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
1 ||| on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
0 ||| the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
0 ||| disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
1 ||| aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
0 ||| the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
0 ||| i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
0 ||| too slow , too long and too little happens . 
1 |||  . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
1 ||| writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
0 ||| it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
1 ||| here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get . 
1 ||| qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere . 
0 ||| a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
0 ||| in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
1 ||| morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
1 ||| arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
1 ||| together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
1 ||| it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
0 ||| as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
0 ||| although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
1 ||| the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed . 
0 ||| [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
1 ||| max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished . 
1 ||| if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
1 ||| there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
1 ||| if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
0 ||| an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
1 ||| if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
1 ||| prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
0 ||| an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art . 
0 ||| a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
1 ||| beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
0 ||| sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
0 |||  . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
1 ||| an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
0 ||| all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
0 ||| oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
1 ||| an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller . 
1 ||| bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
1 ||| ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
0 ||| hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
1 ||| may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
0 ||| its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
1 ||| as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . 
0 ||| bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
0 ||| the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
0 ||| it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
1 ||| one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
0 ||| presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
0 ||| skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
0 ||| part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
0 ||| the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
0 ||| abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
1 ||| asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
0 ||| once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
1 ||| a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
0 ||| amid the clich� and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
1 ||| the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
0 ||| with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
0 ||| michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
1 ||| a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales . 
0 ||| this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
1 ||| a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
1 ||| antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
1 ||| workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies . 
1 ||| it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
0 ||| appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
0 ||| the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
1 ||| a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
0 ||| this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
0 ||| what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
0 ||| great story , bad idea for a movie . 
1 ||| majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
0 |||  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
1 ||| a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity . 
1 |||  " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
1 ||| the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative . 
0 ||| an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
1 ||| a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 
1 ||| a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
1 ||| the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
0 ||| the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
1 ||| it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
1 ||| if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
1 ||| a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
1 ||| it never fails to engage us . 
0 ||| the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
0 ||| a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
1 ||| apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
0 ||| the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
1 ||| in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
0 ||| few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
0 ||| the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
1 ||| what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is�
0 ||| none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
0 |||  . . . a confusing drudgery . 
0 ||| guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
1 ||| a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
0 ||| the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
0 ||| the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
1 ||| as it turns out , you can go home again . 
1 ||| fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
1 ||| japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . 
1 ||| weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
1 ||| made me unintentionally famous as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen . 
1 ||| laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
1 ||| berry's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making " die another day " one of the most entertaining bonds in years
1 ||| a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
1 ||| two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
1 ||| fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing . 
0 ||| imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
1 ||| at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 
1 ||| meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
0 ||| it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
1 ||| a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
0 ||| that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
1 ||| not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
1 ||| light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
1 ||| a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity . 
1 ||| exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
0 ||| if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
0 ||| it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
0 ||| full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
1 ||| what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
1 ||| for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped .

0 ||| on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
1 ||| between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
1 ||| inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
0 ||| ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich� of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
1 ||| contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
0 ||| the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
1 ||| not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
1 ||| cool ? this movie is a snow emergency . 
0 ||| the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
1 ||| spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are . 
1 ||| a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
0 ||| does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
1 ||| we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it . 
1 ||| ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
0 ||| did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
0 ||| an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
0 ||| this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
1 ||| a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it .

1 ||| devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking . 
1 ||| what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
1 ||| one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight . 
1 ||| engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
1 ||| leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
0 ||| what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
0 ||| as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
1 ||| in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
1 ||| what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is . 
1 ||| the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
0 ||| the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
1 ||| discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
0 ||| the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
0 ||| will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
1 ||| if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
0 ||| wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
0 ||| i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
1 ||| belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
0 ||| [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
1 ||| it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
1 ||| the performances are an absolute joy . 
1 ||| as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
1 ||| steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
0 ||| while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
0 ||| the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
1 ||| represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 
1 ||| one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
1 ||| much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
1 ||| she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
1 ||| the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
1 ||| sch�tte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close . 
1 ||| a remarkable film by bernard rose . 
1 ||| a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
0 ||| screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
1 ||| [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
1 ||| while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo . . . broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
0 ||| frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
0 ||| oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
1 ||| gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traici�n que seguramente se convertir� en un nuevo cl�sico del g�nero . 
0 ||| ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout � and meat loaf explodes . 
0 ||| as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
1 ||| [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
1 ||| a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters . 
1 ||| this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
1 ||| a creaky staircase gothic . 
1 ||| the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
1 ||| leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
0 ||| a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
1 ||| a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
1 ||| mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
1 ||| audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
1 ||| as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
1 ||| lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy . 
0 ||| a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
1 ||| offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
0 ||| formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
1 ||| now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
0 ||| if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
0 ||| bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
1 ||| a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
1 ||| in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
1 ||| at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
1 ||| an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
0 ||| it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
0 ||| a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
1 ||| if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
0 ||| it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
1 ||| an impressive hybrid . 
0 ||| there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
1 ||| this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience . 
0 ||| the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
1 ||| saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . 
0 ||| a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
1 ||| successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
0 ||| koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
0 ||| pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
1 ||| a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 
1 ||| an exhilarating experience . 
1 ||| unflinchingly bleak and desperate
1 ||| huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
0 ||| pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
1 ||| uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
0 ||| if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
1 ||| full of surprises . 
1 ||| talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
1 ||| efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
1 ||| at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . 
1 ||| an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
0 ||| a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
0 ||| the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
1 ||| the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
1 ||| if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life , eisenstein delivers . 
1 ||| a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
1 ||| shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
0 ||| does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
0 ||| it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
1 ||| it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
0 |||  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
0 ||| as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
1 ||| brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
0 |||  . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
1 ||| the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
1 ||| strange it is , but delightfully so . 
0 ||| the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
0 ||| a porn film without the sex scenes . 
0 ||| a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
1 ||| it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
0 ||| john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
0 ||| a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
1 ||| a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
1 ||| maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
1 ||| ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
0 ||| the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
0 ||| unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
0 ||| godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
0 ||| a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
0 ||| director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
0 ||| though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
0 ||| what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
0 ||| with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
0 ||| nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
1 ||| disturbing and brilliant documentary . 
1 ||| brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
0 ||| as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
1 ||| a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
0 ||| sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
1 ||| almost peerlessly unsettling . 
0 ||| everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
0 ||| 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
0 ||| just a kiss is a just a waste . 
1 ||| same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
0 ||| a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
1 ||| in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1 ||| a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
1 ||| runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
0 ||| friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
1 ||| an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
0 |||  . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
0 ||| brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
0 ||| however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
0 ||| there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
0 ||| the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
0 ||| mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
1 ||| very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary . 
1 ||| probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
0 ||| the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
0 ||| the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
0 ||| one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
0 ||| what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
0 ||| a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
1 ||| [hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
0 ||| what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
0 ||| reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
1 ||| writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
1 ||| rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
1 ||| the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
1 ||| nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
0 |||  . . . stale and uninspired . 
1 ||| not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
1 ||| an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 
1 ||| a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
1 ||| the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
1 ||| highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
1 ||| a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 
1 ||| if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is . 
0 ||| there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
0 ||| well-made but mush-hearted . 
1 ||| the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
1 ||| a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch . 
0 ||| hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
0 ||| finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
0 ||| this is really just another genre picture . 
1 ||| grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
1 ||| it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
1 ||| a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'cherish' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
1 ||| an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music . 
1 ||| a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
0 ||| taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
0 ||| bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
0 ||| william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
1 ||| it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
1 |||  . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . 
0 ||| the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
0 ||| for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
0 ||| what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
0 ||| it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
1 ||| the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
0 ||| strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild . 
1 ||| while there are times when the film's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it doesn't . 
1 ||| the script is smart , not cloying . 
1 ||| secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
1 ||| though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film . 
1 ||| jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
0 ||| it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
1 ||| there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
0 |||  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
0 ||| more maudlin than sharp . 
0 ||| with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich�s . 
1 ||| while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
0 ||| buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich�s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
0 ||| oozes condescension from every pore . 
1 ||| although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
0 ||| cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
0 ||| it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
0 ||| it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
1 ||| an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
1 ||| noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
1 ||| a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
0 ||| is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
1 ||| the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
0 ||| this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
1 ||| with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
1 ||| spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences . 
1 ||| at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
0 ||| there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
1 ||| finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
1 ||| enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
0 ||| this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
0 ||| even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
1 ||| based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
0 ||| this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
0 ||| as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
0 ||| dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
0 ||| anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
1 ||| you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
1 ||| a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
0 |||  " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
0 ||| not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
1 ||| kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
0 ||| new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
0 ||| ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
1 ||| the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
0 ||| robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
0 ||| at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
0 ||| the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
0 ||| like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
1 ||| a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
1 ||| dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . " 
0 ||| egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
1 ||| a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
0 ||| after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
0 ||| while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
1 ||| britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway . 
0 ||| choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '

1 ||| what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
0 ||| the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
0 ||| elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
0 ||| there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
1 ||| as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
1 ||| perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
0 ||| a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
1 |||  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
1 ||| if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
1 ||| it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
0 ||| a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
1 ||| moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
0 ||| what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
0 ||| the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
1 ||| none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
0 ||| what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
0 ||| it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
1 ||| it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
1 ||| k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
0 ||| the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
1 ||| intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
0 ||| the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
1 ||| graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies . 
1 ||| if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
1 ||| the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre .

1 ||| refreshing . 
0 ||| death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
0 ||| the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
1 ||| it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
1 ||| it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
0 |||  . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
0 ||| anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
0 ||| except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
0 ||| the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
0 ||| a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
0 ||| a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
0 ||| just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
0 ||| the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
1 ||| by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
0 ||| it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world . 
0 ||| the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
0 ||| neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
1 ||| p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
0 ||| the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
0 ||| doesn't amount to much of anything . 
1 ||| director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
1 ||| the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
1 ||| martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
0 ||| the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
1 ||| from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
1 ||| this amiable picture talks tough , but it's all bluster -- in the end it's as sweet as greenfingers . . . 
0 ||| it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
1 ||| drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power . 
1 ||| although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude . 
1 ||| an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values . 
1 ||| some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
1 ||| despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
0 ||| contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
0 ||| first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction . 
0 ||| [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
0 ||| one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
1 ||| morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
1 ||| jackson is always watchable . 
1 ||| stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
1 ||| one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
0 ||| if only it were , well , funnier . 
0 ||| the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
0 ||| real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
1 ||| a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
1 ||| when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
0 ||| the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
1 ||| the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
0 ||| it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
1 ||| this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
0 ||| plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
1 ||| victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
1 ||| far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
1 ||| there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
1 ||| es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprender� . 
1 ||| a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
1 ||| a portrait of an artist . 
0 ||| it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
1 ||| if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
0 ||| the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joff� and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
0 ||| a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
0 ||| although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
0 ||| once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
1 ||| reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others . it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them . 
0 ||| [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
0 ||| ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
0 ||| rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
1 ||| a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser . 
1 ||| ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
1 ||| cusack's just brilliant in this . 
0 ||| enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
0 ||| blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
0 ||| though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
1 ||| smart and taut . 
1 ||| solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
0 ||| the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
1 ||| an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
0 ||| shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
0 ||| tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
1 ||| cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
0 ||| an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
1 ||| standing by yourself is haunting . . . [it's] what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . 
0 ||| it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
1 ||| like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock . 
1 ||| the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
0 ||| i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
0 ||| his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
1 ||| it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
1 ||| the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . 
1 ||| monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
0 ||| sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
1 ||| the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection . 
0 ||| sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its �lan , humor , bile , and irony . 
0 ||| the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
1 ||| the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
1 ||| the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
1 |||  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
1 ||| on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
0 ||| a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
1 ||| even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
0 ||| just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
0 ||| an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
1 |||  " simone " is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality . 
0 ||| after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
1 ||| there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
0 ||| with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
0 ||| overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
0 ||| the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
1 ||| with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare . 
1 ||| a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
0 ||| the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
0 ||| not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
1 ||| not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
1 ||| my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
0 ||| the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
0 ||| behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
1 ||| both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . 
0 ||| it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
1 ||| manages to delight without much of a story . 
1 ||| for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
0 ||| a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
1 ||| a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
1 ||| the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
0 ||| 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
1 ||| great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex . 
1 ||| he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
1 ||| satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
0 ||| purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
1 ||| there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
1 ||| funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
1 ||| a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
0 ||| the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
1 ||| there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
1 ||| [has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
1 ||| amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
1 ||| a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
1 ||| just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
1 ||| the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
0 ||| this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
0 ||| it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
1 ||| beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . 
1 ||| it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
0 ||| jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
0 ||| none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
0 ||| no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
1 ||| with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry . 
0 ||| two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
1 ||| my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
1 ||| grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that's all that matters . 
0 ||| cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
0 ||| the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
1 ||| though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
1 ||| if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
1 ||| beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
1 ||| jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
1 ||| quite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to . 
0 ||| if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
1 ||| a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
1 ||| begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
1 ||| it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
1 ||| by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster . 
1 ||| by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit . 
0 ||| somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
0 ||| ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
1 ||| too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
1 ||| graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world . 
1 ||| an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
1 ||| fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
0 ||| boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
1 ||| touch� ! 
0 ||| the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
1 ||| worth the effort to watch . 
1 ||| it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
1 ||| a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
1 ||| there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
1 ||| davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
0 ||| 'carente de imaginaci�n , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un �pice de romance , es una verdadera p�rdida de tiempo y dinero'
0 ||| festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
1 ||| in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
0 ||| bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
0 ||| it tells more than it shows . 
1 ||| this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
1 ||| with 'bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear . 
0 ||| [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
1 |||  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . " 
1 ||| a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
0 ||| the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
1 ||| the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
1 ||| this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
0 ||| the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
0 ||| the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
0 ||| with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
1 ||| maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
1 ||| it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
1 ||| skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
1 ||| half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film
1 ||| adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
0 ||| the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
0 ||| without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
0 ||| an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
0 ||| it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
1 |||  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
0 ||| 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
0 ||| whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
1 ||| offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
1 ||| the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness � which makes for a terrifying film . 
1 ||| by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
0 ||| professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
1 ||| mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
0 ||| friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
0 ||| never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
1 ||| it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
1 ||| that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
0 ||| after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
1 ||| the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
1 ||| even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
0 ||| an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
0 ||| i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
0 ||| had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
0 ||| adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
1 ||| insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
0 ||| home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
1 ||| toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
0 ||| the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
1 ||| a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
1 ||| happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
0 ||| a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
0 ||| i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes . 
1 ||| spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
0 ||| a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
1 ||| lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
0 ||| plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
0 ||| the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
1 ||| not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet . 
1 ||| talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing . 
0 ||| a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
0 ||| there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
1 ||| both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others . 
1 ||| brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
0 ||| the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
1 ||| sexy and romantic . 
0 ||| if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
0 ||| an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
1 ||| a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
1 ||| it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
1 ||| kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
1 ||| the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
1 ||| [a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
1 ||| a lovably old-school hollywood confection . 
1 ||| it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . 
1 ||| a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
0 ||| give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
0 ||| [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
0 ||| talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
0 |||  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
1 ||| what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
1 ||| showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
1 ||| viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
0 ||| i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
0 ||| rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
1 ||| an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
1 ||| a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
1 ||| the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers . 
0 ||| the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
0 ||| the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clich�d and too often strains credulity . 
1 ||| it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth . 
1 ||| a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
1 ||| scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
1 ||| you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear . 
1 ||| the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
0 ||| has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
0 ||| there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
1 ||| the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
1 ||| [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
1 ||| the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame . 
0 ||| paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
0 ||| only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
1 ||| it's never dull and always looks good . 
0 ||| not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
1 ||| time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
0 ||| the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
0 ||| a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
0 |||  . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
0 ||| so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
1 ||| kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . 
1 ||| although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
0 ||| one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
1 ||| tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
1 ||| while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
0 ||| it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
0 ||| the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
1 ||| although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan . 
0 ||| i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
1 ||| steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
1 ||| it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
1 ||| a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth . 
0 ||| unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
0 ||| tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
0 ||| delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
0 ||| nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
0 ||| i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
1 ||| those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
0 ||| it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
1 ||| features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
1 ||| for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
0 ||| we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
0 ||| well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
1 ||| this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
1 ||| a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life . 
1 ||| katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
0 ||| the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
0 ||| adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
0 ||| the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
1 ||| the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
1 ||| it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
1 ||| time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
1 ||| dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed . 
0 ||| the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
1 |||  . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
0 ||| the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
1 ||| the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
0 ||| the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
0 ||| perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
1 ||| the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
0 ||| so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
1 ||| it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
1 ||| a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
1 ||| [a] rare , beautiful film . 
0 ||| as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
0 ||| most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
0 ||| the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
0 ||| elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
0 ||| the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
0 ||| a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
0 ||| it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
1 ||| formuliac , but fun . 
0 ||| these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
1 ||| enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
1 ||| there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
0 ||| the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
1 ||| one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year . 
1 ||| robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
1 ||| it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
1 ||| fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
0 ||| a era do gelo diverte , mas n�o convence . � um passatempo descompromissado � e s� . 
0 ||| was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
0 ||| pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
1 ||| a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
0 ||| i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
1 ||| fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
1 ||| witless but watchable . 
1 ||| for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
0 ||| the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
1 ||| it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
0 ||| never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
1 ||| the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
0 |||  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
0 ||| a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
0 ||| [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
0 ||| if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
0 ||| it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
0 ||| a workshop mentality prevails . 
1 ||| what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
0 ||| has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
1 ||| for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
1 ||| for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
1 ||| if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
1 ||| the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
0 ||| it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
1 ||| the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
0 ||| denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
0 ||| watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
0 ||| anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
1 ||| skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
0 ||| a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
0 ||| after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
0 ||| despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
0 ||| will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
0 ||| the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
0 ||| suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
1 ||| it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
0 ||| nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
1 ||| certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
0 ||| when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
0 ||| the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
0 ||| so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
0 ||| an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
0 ||| a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
1 ||| i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
1 ||| it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year . 
0 ||| a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
0 ||| holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
1 ||| that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend . 
0 ||| too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
1 ||| a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
1 ||| when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
0 ||| the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
0 ||| even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
0 ||| can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
0 ||| all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
1 ||| the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed . 
0 ||| by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
1 ||| dense , exhilarating documentary . 
0 ||| the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
1 ||| it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
1 ||| if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . 
1 ||| if you dig on david mamet's mind tricks . . . rent this movie and enjoy ! 
0 ||| typical anim� , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
0 ||| this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
1 ||| has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
1 ||| os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman s�o complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
1 ||| a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . 
0 ||| like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
0 ||| we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
0 ||| [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
1 ||| a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
1 ||| jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair . 
0 ||| only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
0 ||| what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
0 ||| less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
1 ||| it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
0 ||| a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
0 ||| it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
1 ||| unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
0 ||| made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
0 ||| entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
0 ||| the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
0 ||| plays like john le carr� with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
0 ||| qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
1 |||  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
0 ||| it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
0 ||| this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
0 ||| 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
0 ||| lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
0 ||| the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
1 ||| some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
0 ||| a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
1 ||| marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film . 
0 ||| meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
0 ||| a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
1 ||| a very charming and funny movie . 
1 ||| a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 
0 ||| ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
1 ||| one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 
0 ||| manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
0 ||| will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
1 ||| the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
0 ||| there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
0 ||| low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
0 ||| the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
0 ||| a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
0 ||| with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
1 ||| a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film . search it out . 
1 ||| the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
0 ||| far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
0 ||| the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
1 ||| what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
1 ||| when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
1 ||| as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
1 ||| the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
0 ||| wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
0 ||| fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience . 
1 ||| theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
0 ||| [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
1 ||| shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
0 ||| the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
1 ||| a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
0 ||| heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
1 ||| open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
0 ||| glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
0 ||| the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
0 ||| a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
1 ||| some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors . 
0 ||| a moving picture that does not move . 
1 ||| it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
0 ||| feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
0 ||| a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
0 ||| the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
1 ||| a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy . 
1 ||| the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
0 ||| a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
0 |||  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
0 ||| it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
0 ||| the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
1 ||| hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
1 ||| one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade . 
0 ||| a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
1 ||| a no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
1 ||| the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
1 ||| really quite funny . 
1 ||| much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
1 ||| the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
0 ||| veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
0 ||| a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
0 ||| what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
1 ||| the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
0 ||| as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
0 ||| instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
0 ||| ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
1 ||| taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
1 ||| you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 
0 ||| mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
0 ||| it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
1 ||| it strikes hardest when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
1 ||| thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
0 ||| heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
1 ||| a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
1 ||| this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
0 ||| i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
0 ||| outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
0 ||| all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
0 ||| an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
1 ||| feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
0 ||| to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
0 ||| everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
0 ||| exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
1 ||| guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled . 
1 ||| never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
0 ||| it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
0 ||| deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
1 ||| an original gem about an obsession with time . 
1 ||| it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious . 
0 ||| those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
0 ||| sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
0 ||| there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
1 ||| unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
1 ||| if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
0 ||| without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
0 ||| the film is strictly routine . 
0 ||| never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
0 ||| a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
1 ||| likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
0 ||| when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
1 ||| the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in " last dance " ] . 
1 ||| mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
0 ||| just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
0 ||| this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
1 ||| it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
1 ||| weird . rewarding . 
0 ||| the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
0 ||| its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
1 ||| this slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
1 ||| the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
1 ||| would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
0 ||| it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
1 ||| caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
1 ||| there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
0 ||| millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
0 ||| an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
1 ||| dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
1 |||  the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
1 ||| the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
0 ||| a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
1 ||| gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
0 ||| the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
1 ||| comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
1 ||| the movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
1 ||| jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism . 
0 ||| for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
1 ||| a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
0 ||| though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
0 ||| mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
1 ||| [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
1 ||| gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
1 ||| oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
1 ||| even better than the first one ! 
0 ||| if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
1 ||| one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised . 
0 ||| if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
1 ||| a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
0 ||| its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
1 ||| it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
0 ||| there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
1 ||| i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
0 ||| affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
1 |||  . . . a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations . 
0 ||| it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
0 ||| the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
1 ||| poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
0 ||| plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
0 ||| so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
0 ||| go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
1 ||| [a] satisfying niblet . 
0 ||| not once does it come close to being exciting . 
0 ||| where the film falters is in its tone . 
0 ||| a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
1 ||| the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . . 
0 ||| a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
1 ||| strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
1 ||| winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
1 ||| keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
1 ||| for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way . 
0 ||| a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
1 ||| my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
1 ||| the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
1 ||| about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
1 ||| a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
1 ||| it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
1 ||| a cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
0 ||| like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
1 ||| feels untidily honest . 
1 ||| sure , i hated myself in the morning . but then again , i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . 
1 ||| often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
0 |||  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
1 ||| sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodram�ticos para arrancar l�grimas do espectador , o pianista � um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
0 ||| like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
1 ||| an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
1 ||| a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
1 ||| director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . . 
0 ||| earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
1 ||| nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
1 ||| a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
1 ||| you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
0 ||| an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
0 ||| a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
0 ||| just a bloody mess . 
0 ||| dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
0 ||| below is well below expectations . 
1 ||| schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
1 ||| [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
1 ||| a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
1 ||| labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
0 ||| christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
1 ||| arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation . 
1 ||| montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . 
0 ||| chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
1 ||| allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years . 
0 ||| while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
1 ||| scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
1 ||| claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
0 ||| like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
0 ||| carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0 ||| director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
1 ||| there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
1 ||| a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . 
0 ||| a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
1 ||| this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
0 ||| it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
1 ||| the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
0 ||| if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
1 ||| [a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
1 ||| highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . 
0 ||| a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
0 ||| every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
1 ||| i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
1 ||| an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
0 ||| memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
0 ||| a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
1 ||| lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
0 ||| overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
1 ||| sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
1 ||| damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
0 ||| it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
0 ||| cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
0 ||| the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
0 ||| the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
0 ||| roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
1 ||| the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 
1 ||| hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
1 ||| pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
0 ||| by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie . 
0 ||| though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clich� . 
1 ||| the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
0 ||| a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
0 ||| audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
1 ||| blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
1 ||| very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
0 ||| about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
0 ||| i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
0 ||| adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
1 ||| denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . 
1 ||| clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
1 |||  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
0 ||| cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
0 ||| the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
1 ||| remarkably accessible and affecting . 
1 ||| so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
0 ||| ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
1 ||| you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
0 ||| the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
0 ||| every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
0 ||| this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
0 ||| the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
0 ||| gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
0 ||| it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
1 ||| as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
1 ||| an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
0 ||| overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
1 ||| rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
1 ||| awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
1 ||| thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
1 |||  . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i've seen in quite a long time . 
0 ||| sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
0 ||| the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
0 ||| swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
1 ||| the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
1 ||| leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
1 ||| this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
1 ||| occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
1 ||| a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
1 ||| an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
0 ||| it recycles every clich� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
1 ||| despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
0 ||| a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise . 
1 ||| the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
1 ||| see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
1 ||| smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 
1 ||| a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
1 ||| a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
0 ||| it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m�tier . 
0 ||| new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
0 ||| the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
0 ||| a puzzling experience . 
0 ||| unwieldy contraption . 
0 ||| an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
1 |||  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that when it comes to truncheoning it's better to give than to receive . 
1 ||| it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
0 ||| the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
1 |||  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
1 ||| what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
1 ||| soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
0 ||| the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
0 ||| when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
1 |||  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
1 ||| one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
1 ||| there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
0 ||| one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
1 ||| assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel . 
1 ||| bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
1 ||| while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in . 
0 ||| it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
1 ||| davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
0 ||| the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
1 ||| there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
0 ||| some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
1 ||| it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
1 ||| a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes . 
0 ||| grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
0 ||| about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
0 ||| not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
0 ||| a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
1 ||| a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 
0 ||| most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
0 ||| allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
1 ||| if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
1 ||| from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
0 ||| if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
0 ||| it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
0 ||| liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
1 ||| even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
1 ||| bring on the sequel . 
1 ||| a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom � handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 
0 ||| comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
1 ||| precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . anyone else seen this before ? 
0 ||| a dreadful live-action movie . 
0 ||| a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
0 ||| more tiring than anything . 
1 ||| an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
1 ||| a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
1 ||| with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 
1 ||| like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
1 ||| an asian neo-realist treasure . 
0 ||| a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
1 ||| the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
0 ||| ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
1 ||| sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation . 
0 ||| as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
1 ||| this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
0 ||| the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
0 ||| it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
1 ||| a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
1 ||| a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . 
1 ||| cho's timing is priceless . 
0 ||| you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
1 ||| offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . 
1 ||| faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
1 ||| hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
1 ||| i like this movie a lot . i like that smith , he's not making fun of these people , he's not laughing at them . 
1 ||| that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle . 
0 ||| though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
0 ||| the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
0 ||| every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
0 ||| involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
0 ||| a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
1 ||| forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
0 ||| this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
1 ||| a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow . 
1 ||| a tremendous piece of work . 
1 ||| a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
0 ||| as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
1 ||| one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
0 ||| an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
1 ||| jacquot's tosca is a treat . 
0 ||| ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
1 ||| the pianist is polanski's best film . 
0 ||| i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich� . 
1 ||| ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
0 |||  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
1 ||| although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america . 
0 ||| when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
0 ||| fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
0 ||| showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
0 ||| at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
0 ||| remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
0 ||| the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
0 ||| corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
1 ||| it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
1 ||| the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . 
0 ||| the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
1 ||| manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
0 ||| the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
0 ||| follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
0 ||| director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
1 ||| its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart . 
0 ||| a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
0 ||| another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
0 ||| steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
0 ||| witless and utterly pointless . 
0 ||| scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
0 ||| what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
1 ||| a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
0 ||| it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
1 ||| straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
1 ||| a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
1 ||| a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it . 
0 ||| spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
0 ||| simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
0 ||| i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
0 ||| a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
0 ||| from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
0 ||| la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , r�pidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
0 ||| 90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
0 ||| collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
0 ||| this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
0 ||| all mood and no movie . 
1 ||| often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american 'hosts' and their 'guests . '
0 ||| a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
0 ||| it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
1 ||| family fare . 
1 ||| 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
0 ||| technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
0 ||| i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
0 ||| love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit . 
1 ||| definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
0 ||| mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
1 ||| here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
1 ||| escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
0 ||| a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 
1 ||| there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
0 ||| at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
1 ||| if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness . 
0 ||| it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
0 ||| in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
0 ||| you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
1 ||| highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
1 ||| gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
1 ||| a witty , whimsical feature debut . 
0 ||| the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
0 ||| this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
0 ||| high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
1 ||| a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
1 ||| a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
1 ||| the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 
0 ||| an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
1 ||| muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
1 ||| one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
1 ||| a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival . 
1 ||| both damning and damned compelling . 
1 ||| pretty good little movie . 
0 ||| simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
0 ||| not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
0 ||| the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
0 ||| painfully padded . 
0 ||| a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
0 ||| the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
0 ||| while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
1 ||| grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
1 ||| the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
0 ||| once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
1 ||| it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
1 ||| [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists . 
0 ||| the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
0 ||| this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
1 ||| this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade . 
0 ||| to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
1 ||| not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
0 ||| a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
1 ||| it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
1 ||| as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
0 ||| it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
1 ||| it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
0 ||| based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
0 ||| thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
0 ||| too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
0 ||| the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
1 ||| a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
0 ||| everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
0 ||| nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
0 ||| this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
1 ||| murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
0 ||| no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
1 ||| flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
0 ||| expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
1 ||| [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
1 ||| an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation . 
0 ||| hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
1 ||| intriguing and downright intoxicating . 
0 ||| shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
1 ||| renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
0 ||| a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
1 ||| both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
1 ||| as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
1 ||| the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 
0 ||| klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
0 ||| even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
0 ||| the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
0 ||| could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
1 ||| the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses . 
0 ||| i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
0 ||| the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
1 ||| mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
1 ||| a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
1 ||| a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
1 ||| an interesting look behind the scenes of chicago-based rock group wilco . . . 
1 ||| a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
0 ||| this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
0 ||| white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else . 
0 ||| has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
0 ||| possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
1 ||| watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
1 ||| a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
0 ||| doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
0 ||| exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
0 ||| a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
1 ||| sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments . 
1 ||| a delightful coming-of-age story . 
1 ||| a smart little indie . 
0 ||| cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
1 ||| made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
1 ||| it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . 
0 ||| for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
0 ||| it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
0 ||| the comedy is nonexistent . 
0 ||| just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
1 ||| surprisingly insightful
0 ||| a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
0 ||| yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
0 ||| more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
0 ||| a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
0 ||| its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
1 ||| generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
0 ||| an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
1 ||| not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
0 ||| it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
1 ||| ' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
1 ||| whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
1 ||| one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
0 ||| the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
1 ||| a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
0 ||| will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
0 ||| the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
1 ||| a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
1 ||| smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise . 
1 ||| miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
1 ||| part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
1 ||| son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness . 
0 ||| a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
0 ||| i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
1 ||| the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 
0 ||| we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
1 ||| chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident . 
1 ||| the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
0 ||| an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
1 ||| bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
1 ||| to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
1 ||| it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
0 ||| a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
1 ||| barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
1 ||| u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts . 
0 ||| for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
1 ||| [ " take care of my cat " ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
0 ||| why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
1 ||| at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
1 ||| lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
0 ||| it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
0 ||| it's not original enough . 
0 ||| the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
0 ||| tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
1 ||| an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
1 ||| enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
0 ||| most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
0 ||| it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
1 ||| whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
1 ||| hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
0 ||| how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
1 ||| the closest thing to the experience of space travel
1 ||| peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
1 ||| gra�as �s intera��es entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se n�o apenas uma hist�ria divertida sobre uma curiosa persegui��o , mas tamb�m um belo estudo de personagens . 
1 ||| a quiet , pure , elliptical film
1 ||| tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written . 
1 ||| a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
0 ||| the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
0 ||| despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
0 ||| about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
1 ||| it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
1 ||| high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
0 ||| twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
1 ||| thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
1 ||| sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
0 ||| impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
0 ||| i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
1 ||| the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
0 ||| a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
0 ||| theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
1 ||| delirious fun . 
1 ||| rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
0 ||| the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
0 ||| much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
1 ||| nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
0 ||| there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
0 ||| a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . 
0 ||| utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
1 ||| [a] strong piece of work . 
1 ||| the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
1 ||| a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
0 ||| dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
0 ||| as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
0 ||| writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
0 ||| for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
0 ||| barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
1 ||| if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
1 ||| the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
0 ||| bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
0 ||| this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
0 ||| i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
0 ||| there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
1 ||| both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas . 
0 ||| these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
0 ||| a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
1 ||| it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
1 ||| harmless fun . 
1 ||| this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
0 ||| at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
1 ||| a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
1 ||| a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
1 ||| as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
0 ||| diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
1 ||| charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
1 ||| judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
0 ||| if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
1 ||| shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
0 ||| the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
1 ||| the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
0 ||| rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
0 ||| a little too pat for its own good . 
1 ||| that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
0 ||| the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
0 ||| they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
0 ||| chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
0 ||| well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
1 ||| reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show . 
0 |||  . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
1 ||| i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
1 ||| gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
1 ||| all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable . 
0 ||| what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
0 ||| like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
0 ||| a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
0 ||| the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
1 ||| it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
1 ||| thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
0 ||| too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
1 ||| jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
1 ||| brilliantly explores the conflict between following one's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
0 ||| arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
0 ||| succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
0 ||| works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
1 ||| smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
1 ||| it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting . 
1 ||| lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest . 
1 ||| an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
1 ||| liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
1 ||| a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . 
0 ||| large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
0 ||| the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
1 ||| as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms . vardalos' memories and insights . 
1 ||| leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love . 
0 ||| if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
0 |||  . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
1 ||| the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
1 ||| performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
1 ||| to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
0 ||| writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
0 ||| deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
1 ||| both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement . 
1 ||| it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
0 ||| whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
0 ||| after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
0 ||| a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
1 ||| one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 
0 ||| watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
1 |||  . . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over . 
0 ||| the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
1 ||| the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
0 ||| when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
1 ||| evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
1 ||| a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
0 ||| the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
1 ||| claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
1 ||| jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
0 |||  . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
1 ||| the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
1 ||| she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
0 ||| every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
0 ||| take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
0 ||| its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
0 ||| it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
1 ||| a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy . 
0 ||| [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
1 ||| charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
0 ||| impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
0 |||  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
0 ||| the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
0 |||  . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
0 ||| gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
1 ||| a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
0 ||| it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
0 ||| gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
1 ||| hard to resist . 
0 ||| the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
0 ||| soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
1 ||| an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
1 ||| a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
1 ||| a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
0 ||| a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
0 ||| when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
1 ||| transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
1 ||| the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
0 ||| showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
0 ||| some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
1 ||| a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
0 ||| it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
1 ||| ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family . 
0 ||| the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
0 ||| ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
1 ||| it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
0 ||| it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
0 ||| rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
1 ||| the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
1 ||| the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
0 ||| 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
1 ||| a true pleasure . 
1 ||| the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear . 
0 ||| collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
1 ||| it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 
1 ||| the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
0 ||| this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
1 ||| to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
0 ||| if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
0 ||| one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
0 |||  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
0 ||| while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
1 ||| it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
1 ||| viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
0 ||| whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
0 ||| ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
1 ||| wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
0 ||| chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
1 ||| what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
1 ||| either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
0 ||| lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
1 ||| parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
1 ||| gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
0 ||| call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
1 ||| the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
0 ||| a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
0 ||| depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
0 ||| eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
1 ||| this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
0 |||  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
0 ||| the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
0 ||| borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
0 ||| if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
0 ||| mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
1 ||| what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
0 ||| when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
1 ||| it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . 
1 ||| here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
1 ||| nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
1 ||| thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods . 
0 ||| starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
0 ||| charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
0 ||| rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na�f's encounter with the world . 
0 ||| velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
1 ||| a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans . 
1 ||| between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
0 ||| phoned-in business as usual . 
1 ||| it's the sweet cinderella story that " pretty woman " wanted to be . 
0 ||| despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
0 ||| every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
0 ||| dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
1 ||| [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
0 ||| the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
0 ||| according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
1 ||| like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
0 ||| goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
1 ||| o �ltimo suspeito ganha for�a ao tamb�m funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar . 
1 ||| be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook . 
1 ||| just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
0 ||| as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
0 ||| in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
0 ||| there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
0 ||| by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
0 ||| the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
1 ||| the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
1 ||| less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 . 
1 ||| far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . 
0 ||| afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
1 ||| ultimate x is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to espn the magazine . 
1 ||| after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
0 ||| formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
1 ||| does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
0 ||| narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
1 ||| does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
0 ||| ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
0 ||| sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
0 ||| snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
1 ||| just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
1 ||| the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
1 ||| [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
0 ||| it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
0 ||| enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
0 ||| suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
1 ||| biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
1 ||| it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
1 ||| like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
0 ||| in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
0 ||| for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
0 ||| `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
0 ||| the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
1 ||| it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
1 ||| deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world . 
0 ||| while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
0 ||| plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
1 ||| immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
0 ||| theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
0 ||| ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
1 |||  . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . 
0 ||| if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
0 ||| schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
1 ||| 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
1 ||| if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
0 ||| bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
1 ||| though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
1 ||| i don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it's a dish that's best served cold . 
0 ||| it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
0 ||| the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
1 ||| though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . 
0 ||| plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
1 ||| a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . 
0 ||| the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
0 ||| one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
1 ||| so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
0 ||| there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
1 |||  . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 
1 ||| the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
0 ||| exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
0 ||| this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
1 ||| twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . 
0 ||| the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
0 ||| a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
0 ||| a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
1 ||| an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
0 ||| no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
0 |||  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
1 ||| a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
0 ||| overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
0 ||| just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
0 ||| wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
0 ||| unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
0 ||| after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
0 ||| one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
1 ||| close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
0 ||| the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
1 ||| richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
1 ||| visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
0 |||  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
1 ||| the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
0 ||| it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
1 ||| the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
0 ||| the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
1 ||| it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
0 ||| even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
0 ||| the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
1 ||| oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation . 
0 ||| `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
0 |||  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
1 ||| though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
0 ||| some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
1 ||| most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
0 ||| if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
1 ||| nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
0 ||| the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
0 ||| feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
1 ||| ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
0 ||| is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
0 ||| what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
0 ||| [a] slummer . 
0 ||| too silly to take seriously . 
0 ||| you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
0 ||| the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue .

0 ||| the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
1 ||| a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
0 ||| very stupid and annoying . 
1 ||| branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . 
1 ||| the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
1 ||| with " ichi the killer " , takashi miike , japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . . 
0 ||| the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
1 ||| it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
1 ||| macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
1 ||| invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .

0 ||| the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .

1 ||| it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
0 ||| this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
1 ||| as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
1 ||| spare yet audacious . . . 
1 ||| like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
0 ||| this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .

1 ||| the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
1 |||  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
1 ||| an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
0 ||| what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
1 ||| a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
1 |||  . . . quite endearing . 
1 ||| starts slowly , but adrien brody � in the title role � helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
0 ||| the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
1 ||| norton is magnetic as graham . 
1 |||  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
1 ||| like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
0 ||| the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
0 ||| it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller . 
0 |||  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .

1 ||| a delirious celebration of the female orgasm . 
1 ||| a weird and wonderful comedy . 
1 ||| the most consistently funny of the austin powers films . 
0 ||| it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
1 ||| pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
1 ||| a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
1 ||| a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
0 ||| mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .

0 ||| those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
1 ||| while guzm�n frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable . 
1 ||| kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth . 
0 ||| not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
0 ||| the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
1 ||| it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '
1 ||| yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 
1 ||| the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real .

1 ||| seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
0 ||| how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
1 ||| although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . 
0 ||| a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
0 ||| a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
0 ||| labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
0 ||| horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
1 ||| aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
0 ||| de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
0 ||| it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
1 ||| a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
1 ||| ranks among willams' best screen work . 
0 ||| handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
0 ||| a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
1 ||| the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
1 ||| blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
0 ||| a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
1 ||| the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . 
0 ||| in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
0 ||| despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
1 |||  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
0 ||| an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
1 ||| the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
0 ||| a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
0 ||| tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
1 ||| there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
1 ||| serious and thoughtful . 
1 ||| the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
1 ||| daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain . 
0 ||| there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
0 ||| the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
1 ||| subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius . 
0 ||| it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
1 ||| fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
0 ||| as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
1 ||| a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
0 ||| the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
0 ||| aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
1 ||| look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
1 ||| a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
1 ||| there's . . . an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm . 
1 ||| the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye . 
1 ||| great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
1 ||| smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country . 
0 ||| very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
1 ||| it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
1 ||| if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
0 ||| it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
0 ||| in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
1 ||| a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
1 ||| it will break your heart many times over . 
0 ||| tends to plod . 
0 ||| an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
0 ||| abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
1 ||| ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 
0 ||| many of benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of miami vice . 
1 ||| as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
0 ||| may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
1 ||| a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
0 |||  . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
1 ||| full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
0 ||| at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
0 ||| the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
0 ||| devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
0 ||| frenetic but not really funny . 
1 ||| it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
1 ||| by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
0 ||| it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
0 ||| [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
1 ||| one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
0 ||| pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
0 ||| for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
0 ||| the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
0 ||| by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
0 ||| the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
0 ||| the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you . 
1 ||| the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
0 ||| sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
1 ||| not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
1 ||| attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
0 ||| coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
0 ||| human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
0 ||| several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
1 ||| ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
0 ||| the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
0 ||| the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
1 ||| fierce , glaring and unforgettable . 
1 ||| smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
1 |||  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
0 ||| the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
0 ||| a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
1 ||| easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . 
1 ||| exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming . 
0 ||| rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
0 ||| an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
0 ||| starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
1 ||| this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
1 ||| assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
1 ||| reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
0 ||| schindler's list it ain't . 
1 ||| it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
0 ||| the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
0 ||| a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
0 ||| payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
1 ||| stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
0 ||| while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
0 ||| a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
0 ||| a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
1 ||| chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
1 ||| a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
0 ||| one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
0 ||| they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
0 ||| check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
1 ||| this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first . 
0 ||| the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
1 ||| sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
0 ||| the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
1 ||| a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
1 ||| this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
0 ||| like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
1 ||| it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear . 
1 ||| undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos . 
1 ||| it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
1 ||| more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 � weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema . 
1 ||| compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
1 ||| a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
0 ||| filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
0 ||| this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
1 ||| a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
1 ||| there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy . 
0 ||| the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
0 ||| one of the worst films of 2002 . 
1 ||| the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger .

0 ||| spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
0 ||| swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
1 ||| stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
1 ||| intelligent and moving . 
0 ||| it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
1 ||| full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
1 ||| happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
0 ||| punitively affirmational parable . 
0 ||| for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming .

1 |||  . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
0 ||| a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
1 ||| the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
1 ||| if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
0 ||| a timid , soggy near miss . 
0 ||| too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
1 ||| this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
0 ||| some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .

1 ||| allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
0 ||| paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
1 ||| you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
1 ||| a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
0 ||| the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
1 ||| the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
1 ||| simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . 
1 ||| not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
1 ||| go see it and enjoy . 
0 ||| there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
0 ||| full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
1 ||| this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
1 ||| an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 
1 ||| the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
1 ||| the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
0 ||| a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
1 ||| as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
0 ||| hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff .

0 ||| plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .

1 ||| turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
0 ||| the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .

1 ||| fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
0 ||| a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
1 ||| though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
1 ||| another best of the year selection . 
1 ||| one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
0 |||  . . . one resurrection too many . 
0 ||| more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
1 ||| what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
0 ||| an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
0 ||| the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . 
0 ||| mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
1 ||| together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
0 ||| the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles � several of them . 
1 ||| at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . 
0 ||| hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
1 ||| one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
0 ||| a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
1 ||| the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
0 ||| the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
1 ||| the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting . 
1 ||| a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
0 ||| i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
0 ||| too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
0 ||| the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
1 ||| reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
1 ||| featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0 ||| well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
1 ||| the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
1 ||| despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
1 ||| maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
0 ||| the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
0 ||| perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
0 ||| it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
1 ||| inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
0 ||| it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
0 ||| lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
1 ||| leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
0 ||| fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
0 ||| there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
1 ||| a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
1 ||| the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
0 ||| the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
0 ||| manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
0 ||| the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
0 ||| bad and baffling from the get-go . 
0 ||| we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
0 ||| the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
1 ||| with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises . 
0 ||| in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
0 ||| caso voc� sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do t�rmino da proje��o , n�o se preocupe : ningu�m lhe enviar� penas simbolizando covardia . 
1 ||| the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
0 ||| as pedestrian as they come . 
0 ||| as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
0 ||| the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
1 ||| ultimately , " mib ii " succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
1 ||| the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
0 ||| like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
1 ||| a surprisingly funny movie . 
1 |||  . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
1 ||| the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture . 
0 ||| eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
0 |||  . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
1 ||| the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
1 ||| kinnear gives a tremendous performance . 
1 ||| this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
1 ||| the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
1 ||| although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
0 ||| one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
0 ||| an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
1 ||| cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
0 ||| bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
0 ||| at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
0 |||  . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
1 ||| by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
0 ||| a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
1 ||| god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
0 ||| apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
0 ||| as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
1 ||| if there's one big point to promises , it's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other . 
0 ||| the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
0 ||| it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
0 ||| for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
0 ||| a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
0 ||| i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
1 ||| few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 
1 ||| it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
0 ||| suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
1 ||| a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
1 ||| the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion . 
0 ||| the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
1 ||| one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
1 ||| daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails . 
0 ||| putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
0 ||| as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
1 ||| though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
0 ||| mild , meandering teen flick . 
1 ||| vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 
0 ||| yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
0 ||| ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
0 ||| too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
0 ||| this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
0 ||| screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
1 ||| at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance . 
1 ||| sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
1 ||| the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting . 
1 ||| this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty . 
1 ||| while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
0 ||| the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
1 ||| two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
1 ||| bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
1 ||| a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . 
0 ||| it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
0 ||| this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
1 ||| this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
1 |||  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
0 ||| there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
1 ||| i just loved every minute of this film . 
0 ||| it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
0 ||| the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
0 ||| occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
0 ||| nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
0 ||| ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
0 ||| the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
1 ||| the film's performances are thrilling . 
1 ||| topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
0 ||| the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
1 ||| one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 
1 ||| while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting . 
1 ||| as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
0 ||| i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
0 ||| shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
0 ||| not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
0 ||| while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
1 ||| there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
1 ||| any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
1 ||| a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
0 ||| it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
0 ||| one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
0 ||| despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
1 ||| it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
1 ||| if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
0 ||| nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
0 ||| like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
1 ||| possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
0 ||| an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
1 ||| 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
1 ||| it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
1 ||| passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
0 ||| in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
1 ||| deliciously slow . 
0 ||| the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
1 ||| the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
1 ||| those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time . 
1 ||| neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
1 ||| quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
1 ||| everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids . 
1 ||| it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
0 ||| all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
0 ||| two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
0 ||| a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
1 ||| painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
1 ||| with notorious c . h . o . cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy . 
0 ||| it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
1 ||| a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
0 ||| the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
1 ||| romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . 
1 ||| flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
0 ||| it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
0 ||| lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
0 ||| obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
1 ||| a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
0 ||| if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
0 ||| outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
1 ||| you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
0 ||| the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
0 ||| it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
0 ||| the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
0 ||| everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
0 ||| horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
0 ||| a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
0 ||| its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
0 ||| clever but not especially compelling . 
0 ||| it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
0 ||| fails to bring as much to the table . 
0 ||| the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
0 ||| worthy of the gong . 
1 ||| the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
0 ||| there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
1 ||| nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
1 ||| it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
1 ||| offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication . 
0 |||  . . . a rather bland affair . 
0 ||| given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
1 ||| definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
0 ||| philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
0 ||| harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
0 ||| how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
1 ||| it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
1 ||| generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
0 ||| the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
1 ||| most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
0 |||  . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .

1 ||| the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
0 ||| [a] crushing disappointment . 
1 ||| by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
0 ||| expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
1 ||| it's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
0 ||| faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
1 ||| makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
0 ||| the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
0 ||| sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
1 ||| adaptation is simply brilliant . 
1 ||| cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
1 ||| the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood . 
0 ||| desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
0 ||| you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
0 ||| it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
1 ||| a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
0 ||| the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
0 ||| even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
0 ||| a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit .

0 ||| the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
1 ||| while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii .

0 ||| slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
0 ||| so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
1 ||| it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
0 ||| it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
1 ||| campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution .

1 ||| [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
0 ||| the plan to make enough into �an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a souffl� gone wrong . 
1 ||| sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
1 ||| if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
0 ||| the characters are based on stock clich�s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
0 ||| we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
0 ||| weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
1 ||| a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
1 ||| significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . 
0 ||| [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
1 ||| for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
1 ||| all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . 
0 ||| the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
0 ||| feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
0 ||| that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
1 ||| a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay ! 
0 ||| you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
1 ||| a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
1 ||| what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
1 ||| good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . 
0 ||| an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
0 ||| this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
0 ||| boy oh boy , it's a howler .

1 ||| fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
0 ||| has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
1 ||| the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
0 ||| drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
1 ||| a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
0 ||| offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
1 ||| sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
0 ||| the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
0 |||  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
1 ||| some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since " saving private ryan " have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . 
0 ||| if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
0 ||| not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
1 ||| it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .

1 ||| fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
1 ||| weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
1 ||| mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
0 ||| eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
0 ||| the central story lacks punch . 
0 ||| meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
1 ||| light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
0 ||| christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
1 ||| like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
1 ||| what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
0 ||| 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
1 ||| a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
1 ||| whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
0 ||| attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
0 ||| his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
1 ||| poignant and funny . 
1 ||| it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
0 ||| like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
0 ||| [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
1 ||| woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
1 ||| a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . 
1 ||| implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 
1 ||| fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 
0 ||| flat , misguided comedy . 
1 ||| director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
1 ||| disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical " bedknobs and broomsticks , " which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime . 
0 ||| the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
1 ||| a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
1 ||| compellingly watchable . 
1 ||| the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross's turn as ken . 
0 ||| bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
1 ||| featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
1 ||| a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present . 
0 ||| hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
0 ||| the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
1 ||| although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
0 ||| as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
1 ||| this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
0 ||| in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
0 ||| the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
1 ||| as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
0 ||| a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
0 ||| loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
0 ||| do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
1 ||| what's so striking about jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
1 ||| a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
1 ||| does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
0 ||| the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
1 ||| writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
1 ||| a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
1 ||| a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
0 ||| yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
0 ||| it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
0 ||| when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
0 ||| considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
0 ||| despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
0 ||| barely gets off the ground . 
0 ||| aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
0 ||| somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
1 ||| spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
1 ||| both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
1 ||| nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
0 ||| suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
0 ||| earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
0 ||| a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
0 ||| a listless and desultory affair . 
0 ||| too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
0 ||| this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
0 ||| while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
1 ||| a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . 
0 ||| lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
1 ||| insightfully written , delicately performed
1 ||| a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
1 ||| mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
0 ||| 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
0 ||| humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
0 |||  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
0 ||| shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
1 ||| a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society . 
1 ||| michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
0 ||| serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
1 ||| a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
1 ||| the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
1 ||| it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
1 ||| steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
1 ||| highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
1 ||| at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
0 ||| reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
1 ||| the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
0 ||| if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
0 ||| characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
0 ||| there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
1 ||| the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
0 |||  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
0 ||| alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
0 ||| the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
0 ||| enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
0 ||| deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
1 ||| old-form moviemaking at its best . 
1 ||| the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
0 ||| the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
0 ||| flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
1 ||| it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more . 
1 ||| the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
0 ||| high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
0 ||| i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
0 ||| it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
0 ||| a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
0 ||| there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
0 ||| vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
1 ||| director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
0 |||  if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
0 ||| it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
1 ||| the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
0 ||| i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
1 ||| an ambitious and moving but bleak film . 
0 ||| one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
0 ||| it's all surface psychodramatics . 
0 ||| the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
1 ||| nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
1 ||| thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
1 ||| it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
0 ||| it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
0 ||| it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
0 ||| this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
1 ||| greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
1 ||| even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 
0 ||| the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
0 ||| by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
0 ||| its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
1 ||| i'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . i liked it just enough . 
1 ||| it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
0 ||| this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
0 ||| poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
0 ||| like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
0 ||| the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
0 ||| everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
1 ||| griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
0 ||| his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
0 ||| why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
1 ||| a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
1 ||| this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
1 ||| has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . 
1 ||| hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 
1 ||| an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
1 ||| cuts right through the b . s . giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another . 
1 ||| nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . 
1 ||| chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
1 ||| [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
1 ||| it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise . 
1 ||| by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing . 
0 ||| while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
0 ||| the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
0 ||| wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
1 ||| the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
1 ||| an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
0 ||| it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
1 ||| the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
0 ||| a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
1 ||| becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
1 ||| a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers . 
0 ||| just plain silly . 
0 ||| the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
0 ||| it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
0 ||| there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
0 ||| shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
1 ||| about schmidt belongs to nicholson . gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances . as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance . 
0 ||| one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
1 ||| it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
0 ||| the story really has no place to go since simone is not real�she can't provide any conflict . 
1 ||| a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution . 
1 ||| with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
1 ||| good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
1 ||| not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
0 ||| a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
0 ||| at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
1 |||  . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
0 ||| unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
1 ||| evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
1 ||| it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
1 ||| although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
0 ||| twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
1 ||| makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
1 ||| if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
0 ||| say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
0 ||| there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
0 ||| sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
0 ||| when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
1 ||| because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 
1 ||| there is truth here
1 ||| this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
0 ||| human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
1 ||| the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
0 ||| i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
1 ||| death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
0 ||| as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
0 ||| maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
1 ||| impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
0 ||| for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
0 ||| such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
0 ||| rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
1 ||| buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
1 ||| an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
0 ||| if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
1 ||| because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
1 ||| the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
1 ||| there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
1 ||| a tasty masala . 
1 ||| intimate and panoramic . 
0 ||| unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
1 ||| notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
1 ||| fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
0 ||| will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
1 ||| in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
0 ||| becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
0 ||| the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
1 ||| those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
0 ||| well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
1 |||  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
0 ||| little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
1 ||| even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
0 ||| mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
1 |||  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
1 |||  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
1 ||| boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 
1 ||| witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
0 ||| life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
1 ||| it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
0 ||| forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
0 ||| it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
0 ||| the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
1 ||| this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
1 ||| isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . 
1 ||| [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
0 ||| a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
0 ||| when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
0 ||| the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
1 ||| while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . 
0 ||| with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
0 ||| a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
1 ||| an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
0 ||| simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
1 ||| the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
1 ||| the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
0 ||| boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
0 ||| as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
0 ||| reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
1 ||| i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
0 |||  . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
0 ||| too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
0 ||| there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
1 |||  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
1 ||| this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
1 ||| it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
1 ||| some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
0 ||| a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
1 ||| alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
1 ||| the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
1 ||| fantastic ! 
1 ||| never [sinks] into exploitation . 
1 ||| a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind . 
1 ||| with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie . 
1 ||| red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
0 ||| director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
1 ||| more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
1 ||| for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
0 ||| watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
0 ||| if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
0 ||| there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
1 ||| an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
0 ||| despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
1 ||| if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
0 ||| [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
1 |||  . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
1 ||| personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
0 ||| diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
1 ||| consistently clever and suspenseful . 
1 ||| a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
0 ||| it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
0 ||| equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
0 ||| bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
0 ||| too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
1 ||| chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
0 ||| though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
1 ||| tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
1 ||| move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
0 ||| it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
0 ||| in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
0 ||| would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
1 ||| but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
0 ||| scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
0 ||| during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
0 ||| a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
1 ||| the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
0 ||| in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
0 ||| it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
1 ||| it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
1 ||| the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
1 ||| i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
1 ||| a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
0 ||| certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
0 ||| the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
1 ||| all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
1 ||| evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
1 ||| [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
0 ||| full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
1 ||| an impeccable study in perversity . 
1 ||| takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer
0 ||| a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
0 ||| the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
1 ||| succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
1 ||| in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand . his work with actors is particularly impressive . 
0 ||| a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
0 ||| yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
0 ||| as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
1 ||| the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
0 ||| i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
1 ||| eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . . 
0 ||| to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
0 ||| it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
0 ||| one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
1 ||| jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
1 ||| [an] absorbing documentary . 
0 ||| this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
0 ||| samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
1 ||| as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
0 ||| cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
0 ||| there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
1 ||| this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . 
0 ||| inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
0 ||| sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
1 |||  . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought . 
1 ||| 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
1 ||| just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer . 
0 ||| knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
1 ||| this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
0 ||| so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
1 ||| even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
0 ||| a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
1 ||| may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
0 ||| the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
0 ||| kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
1 ||| yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
0 ||| what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
0 ||| the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
1 ||| a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
1 ||| the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
0 ||| obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
0 ||| helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
0 ||| jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
1 ||| sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
0 ||| the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
1 ||| trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
1 ||| the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
0 ||| the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
1 ||| i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
1 ||| poignant and delicately complex . 
0 ||| all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
1 ||| birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
1 ||| it's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama . 
1 ||| tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
1 ||| an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie . 
0 ||| a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
1 ||| this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
1 ||| could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
1 ||| stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe . 
0 ||| all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
0 ||| love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
0 ||| adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
0 ||| madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
1 |||  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
1 ||| [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
1 ||| a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
0 ||| consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
0 ||| the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
1 ||| a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
1 ||| defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
0 ||| should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
0 ||| several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
0 ||| the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
0 ||| though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
0 ||| the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
0 ||| malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
1 ||| for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outr� sexual practice . 
1 ||| this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap . 
0 ||| generic thriller junk . teens only . 
1 ||| the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
1 ||| it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . 
1 ||| an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
1 ||| you will likely prefer to keep on watching . 
0 ||| the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
1 ||| this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
1 ||| canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
1 ||| a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
1 ||| director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . 
0 ||| any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
0 ||| certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
1 ||| the minor figures surrounding [bobby] . . . form a gritty urban mosaic . 
1 ||| whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
0 ||| does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
1 ||| this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 
1 ||| a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state . 
1 ||| an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences� the ch�teau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
1 ||| this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . 
1 ||| you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
0 ||| ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
1 ||| worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
0 ||| on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
1 ||| moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
0 ||| taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
0 ||| big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
1 ||| even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
1 ||| cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing . 
0 |||  " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
0 ||| nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
0 ||| despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
0 ||| represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
1 ||| the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
0 ||| even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
0 ||| it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
1 ||| a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart . 
1 ||| a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
0 ||| to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
1 ||| a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
0 ||| but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
0 ||| there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
1 ||| even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
0 ||| martin scorsese cria um espet�culo visual que n�o possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
1 ||| a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
0 ||| cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
0 ||| a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
1 ||| sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
0 ||| jonathan parker's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . 
0 ||| the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
1 ||| sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
1 |||  " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
0 ||| with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
0 ||| it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
0 ||| the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
0 ||| demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
1 ||| a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
1 ||| a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
0 ||| almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
1 ||| while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
1 ||| driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
0 ||| visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
0 ||| must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
1 ||| satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
1 ||| the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
1 ||| the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
1 ||| equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
0 ||| ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
0 ||| murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
0 ||| this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
1 ||| a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
0 ||| it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
0 ||| it's just plain boring . 
1 ||| japanese director shohei imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime . 
1 ||| the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
1 ||| contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
1 ||| a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
1 ||| a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
1 |||  ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk . 
1 ||| jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
0 ||| this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
1 ||| astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
1 ||| unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
1 ||| another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . 
0 ||| a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
1 ||| waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it . 
1 ||| a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
0 ||| cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
0 ||| sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
0 ||| all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
0 ||| it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
1 ||| bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
0 ||| a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
0 ||| they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
0 ||| a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
1 ||| a lot smarter than your average bond . 
1 ||| a chick flick for guys . 
1 ||| left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
1 ||| thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
0 ||| a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
0 ||| earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
1 ||| if you can push on through the slow spots , you'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
1 ||| leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
0 ||| always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
0 ||| this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
1 ||| it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 
1 ||| a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
0 ||| a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
1 ||| we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
0 ||| so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
1 ||| with this masterful , flawless film , [wang] emerges in the front ranks of china's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
0 ||| the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
1 ||| takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
0 ||| `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
1 ||| bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
0 ||| it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
1 ||| beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
0 ||| with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
1 ||| we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
1 ||| whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema's master craftsmen . 
1 ||| nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
0 ||| what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
0 ||| much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
1 ||| never once predictable . 
1 ||| it's a masterpiece . 
1 ||| witty , touching and well paced . 
0 ||| what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
1 ||| confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
0 ||| a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
0 ||| myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
0 ||| has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
0 ||| if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
1 ||| it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
1 ||| the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
1 ||| if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
0 ||| this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
1 ||| baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
0 ||| who needs love like this ? 
0 ||| deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
1 ||| meant to reduce blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane's superhero dystopia . 
1 ||| could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
1 ||| a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ? 
1 ||| as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 
1 ||| good , solid storytelling . 
0 ||| a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
1 ||| for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride . 
0 ||| if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
0 |||  " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
1 ||| there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . 
0 ||| a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
1 ||| where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
0 ||| like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
0 ||| when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
1 ||| sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
0 ||| the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
0 ||| i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
1 ||| metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
0 ||| the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
0 ||| fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
0 ||| with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
1 ||| nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 
1 ||| this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
0 ||| de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
1 ||| a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
0 ||| given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
1 ||| fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
1 ||| an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
1 ||| a tour de force of modern cinema . 
0 ||| [it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
1 ||| a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
1 ||| cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
0 ||| like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
1 ||| a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . 
0 ||| it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
0 ||| it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
0 ||| despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
0 ||| the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
0 ||| nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
0 ||| shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
0 ||| consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
0 ||| while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
0 ||| by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
1 ||| lead actress ga� , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
0 ||| this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
1 ||| this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
1 ||| the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
1 ||| a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . 
1 ||| for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son . 
0 ||| it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
0 ||| though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
0 ||| benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
0 ||| enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
0 ||| the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
1 ||| a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
0 ||| pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
0 ||| the worst film of the year . 
1 ||| an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence . 
0 ||| isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
0 ||| the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses and ours and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
0 ||| the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
0 ||| what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
0 ||| sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
0 ||| what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
1 ||| having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
0 ||| unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
1 ||| consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
0 ||| sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
1 ||| a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 
1 ||| [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
1 ||| a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown . 
0 ||| as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
1 ||| what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
1 ||| horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
0 ||| a high-minded snoozer . 
1 ||| what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 
1 ||| the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
0 ||| i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
0 ||| un thriller manqu� qui tombe sur les nerfs presque d�s la premi�re image . 
1 ||| it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
0 ||| director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
1 ||| ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
1 ||| a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
1 ||| a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
1 ||| the best part about " gangs " was daniel day-lewis . 
0 ||| pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
1 ||| this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
1 ||| one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
0 ||| so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
0 |||  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
1 ||| lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
0 |||  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
0 ||| as vulgar as it is banal . 
0 ||| a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
1 ||| mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
1 ||| the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
1 ||| like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
0 ||| i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
0 ||| an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
0 ||| don't even bother to rent this on video . 
1 ||| features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
1 ||| a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 
1 ||| it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
1 ||| how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
0 ||| this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
0 ||| too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
1 |||  . . . begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
1 ||| williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
1 ||| laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
1 ||| even if the ring has a familiar ring , it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
1 ||| a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
0 ||| nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
1 ||| slight but enjoyable documentary . 
0 ||| essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
0 ||| it's one long bore . 
1 ||| it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
1 ||| a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
0 ||| a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
0 ||| one thing's for sure�if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
1 ||| in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel . 
0 ||| it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
1 ||| if you like peace , you'll like promises . 
1 ||| this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
1 ||| a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
0 ||| watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
1 ||| this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
1 ||| remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
1 ||| others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
1 ||| it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
1 ||| solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
0 ||| like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
0 ||| the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
0 ||| on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
0 ||| even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
1 ||| cold , nervy and memorable . 
0 ||| nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
1 ||| stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
0 ||| swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
1 ||| this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
1 ||| an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
1 ||| a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 
1 ||| like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
1 |||  . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
1 ||| '[the cockettes] provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
1 ||| miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
0 ||| the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
1 ||| it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
1 ||| australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
1 ||| the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
0 ||| jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
1 ||| like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
1 ||| wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
0 ||| i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
0 ||| i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
0 ||| nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
0 ||| you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
0 ||| suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
1 ||| if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
1 ||| meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
0 ||| it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
1 ||| dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
1 ||| a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
1 ||| happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music . 
1 ||| it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
0 ||| too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
0 ||| while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
0 ||| hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
1 ||| [director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 
1 ||| travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment . 
0 ||| an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
1 ||| while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it's also full of sharp , smart satire . 
0 ||| as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
1 ||| the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
0 ||| taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
1 ||| one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
1 ||| the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
1 ||| offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through . 
1 ||| fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
1 ||| the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
1 ||| bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
0 ||| a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 
0 ||| a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
0 ||| an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
0 ||| an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
1 ||| it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
0 ||| what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
1 ||| as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile . 
1 ||| in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
1 ||| confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . 
1 ||| affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
1 ||| the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages . 
1 ||| ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . 
1 ||| this is art paying homage to art . 
1 ||| without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen . 
1 ||| a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . 
0 ||| for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
0 ||| aggravating and tedious . 
0 ||| occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
0 ||| talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
0 ||| confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
0 ||| a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
0 ||| although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
1 ||| the performances are remarkable . 
1 ||| all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
0 ||| the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
0 ||| a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
0 ||| the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
0 ||| so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
1 ||| goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 
1 ||| what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
1 ||| it all adds up to good fun . 
0 ||| the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
0 ||| the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
1 ||| at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli . 
1 ||| a vivid cinematic portrait . 
0 ||| overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
0 ||| to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
1 ||| tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
1 ||| byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
0 ||| as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
1 ||| the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
0 ||| both awful and appealing . 
1 ||| a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
0 ||| while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
1 ||| this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 
0 ||| a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
1 ||| against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
0 ||| sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
0 ||| it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
0 ||| some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
0 ||| troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
0 ||| so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
1 ||| the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
0 ||| at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
0 ||| it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
0 ||| works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
0 ||| a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
1 ||| maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements . 
0 ||| apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
0 ||| you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
0 ||| gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
0 ||| just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
1 ||| smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
0 ||| a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
1 ||| one of the best movies of the year . 
0 ||| what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
1 ||| although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
1 ||| pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . 
0 ||| in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
1 ||| an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 
1 ||| collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
0 ||| despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
0 ||| a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
0 ||| arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
1 ||| bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid . 
0 ||| squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
1 |||  " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . 
1 ||| beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
0 ||| portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
0 ||| glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
1 ||| you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
1 ||| a slick , skillful little horror film . 
0 ||| 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
0 ||| a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
1 ||| despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
1 ||| you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated . 
1 ||| so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise . 
0 ||| god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
0 ||| the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
0 ||| a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
0 ||| there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
0 ||| the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
1 ||| a wonderful character-based comedy . 
1 ||| while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious . 
1 ||| even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
0 ||| an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
0 ||| barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
0 ||| a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
0 ||| showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
1 ||| there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
1 ||| the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
1 ||| this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . 
0 ||| too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
0 ||| there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
1 ||| it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout . 
1 ||| often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
1 ||| [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
0 ||| villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
0 |||  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
0 ||| a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
1 |||  " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . " 
0 ||| starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
0 ||| the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
0 ||| skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
1 |||  . . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war . 
0 ||| to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
1 ||| perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
1 |||  " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . " 
1 ||| it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough . 
0 ||| i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
0 ||| anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
1 ||| other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
0 ||| with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
0 ||| chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
0 ||| no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
1 ||| what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
0 ||| when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
0 |||  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
0 ||| weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
1 ||| drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
1 ||| this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
0 ||| the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
0 ||| although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
1 ||| smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
1 ||| the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
1 ||| jagger , stoppard and director michael apted . . . deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride . 
0 ||| this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
1 ||| a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
0 ||| plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
1 ||| the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters . 
0 ||| everyone's to blame here . 
0 ||| characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
1 ||| a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption . 
1 ||| a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
1 ||| at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
1 ||| the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
1 ||| fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
1 ||| open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
1 ||| examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as wiseman's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers . 
0 ||| a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
1 ||| waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
0 ||| mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
1 ||| a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
1 ||| the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them . strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency . 
1 ||| the gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of chris fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel . 
1 ||| stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
1 ||| absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
0 ||| in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
0 ||| don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
1 ||| one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
0 ||| far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
0 |||  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
0 ||| for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
0 ||| stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
1 ||| a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s . 
0 ||| the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
0 ||| [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
1 ||| stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens . 
1 ||| maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment . 
0 ||| the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
1 ||| ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
0 ||| hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
1 ||| despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
1 ||| a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
1 ||| it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
1 ||| [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
0 ||| feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
1 ||| an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
0 ||| it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
1 ||| the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
1 ||| this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
0 ||| it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
1 ||| it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
0 ||| gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
0 ||| the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
0 ||| a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
1 ||| cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
0 ||| even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
0 ||| like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
1 ||| denis and co-writer michele petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing . lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances
0 ||| a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
0 ||| all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . 
1 ||| blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
1 ||| without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
1 ||| a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
1 ||| it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
1 ||| if mr . zhang's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian . 
1 ||| a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
1 ||| a beautifully observed character piece . 
0 ||| to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
1 ||| recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion . 
0 ||| it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
1 ||| there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
1 ||| if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
1 ||| not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
0 ||| [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
1 ||| if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
1 ||| like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
0 ||| strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
1 ||| one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
1 ||| this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
0 ||| shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
1 ||| frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
1 ||| an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
0 ||| not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
1 ||| rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
0 ||| as saccharine as it is disposable . 
1 ||| alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise . 
0 ||| a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
0 ||| anemic , pretentious . 
0 ||| the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
1 ||| although i didn't hate this one , it's not very good either . it can be safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter . 
1 ||| poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
1 ||| with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
1 ||| writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal . 
1 ||| whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
0 ||| hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
1 ||| overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
1 ||| compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
0 ||| the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
1 ||| really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
1 ||| with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
0 ||| as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
1 ||| visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
1 ||| road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
1 ||| [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 
0 ||| as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
0 ||| director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale . 
1 ||| it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
0 ||| the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
0 ||| evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
1 ||| functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
1 ||| smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
0 ||| sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
0 ||| unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
0 ||| one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
0 ||| while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
0 ||| it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
0 ||| i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
1 ||| because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
1 ||| high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast . 
0 ||| i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
1 ||| ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up . 
0 ||| a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
0 ||| strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
1 ||| broomfield turns his distinctive 'blundering' style into something that could really help clear up the case . 
1 ||| if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -� decasia
1 ||| speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life . 
1 ||| although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
1 ||| this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
0 ||| unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
1 ||| deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
0 ||| although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
1 ||| even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
0 ||| things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
0 ||| it bites hard . 
1 ||| if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
1 ||| what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
1 |||  . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
1 ||| falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
1 ||| time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
0 ||| never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
0 ||| yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
0 ||| will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
1 ||| first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
1 ||| an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
1 ||| takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
1 ||| the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . 
0 ||| the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
1 ||| a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clich�s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
0 ||| the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
1 ||| passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
0 ||| a lame comedy . 
1 ||| a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . 
1 ||| some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust . 
1 ||| some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
0 ||| the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
1 ||| what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale � as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
0 ||| jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
1 ||| birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . 
0 ||| this is amusing for about three minutes . 
0 ||| as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
1 ||| scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
1 ||| though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
1 ||| its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
0 ||| it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
0 ||| [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
0 ||| 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
1 ||| jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) . 
1 ||| a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
0 ||| it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
1 ||| terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
1 ||| the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
1 ||| the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
1 ||| a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
0 ||| often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
0 ||| has all the depth of a wading pool . 
0 ||| unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
1 ||| its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . 
0 ||| definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
1 ||| a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
0 ||| newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept � a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
1 ||| 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias rom�nticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
0 ||| [garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
0 ||| it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
0 ||| my own minority report is that it stinks . 
1 ||| sweet and memorable film . 
0 ||| to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
1 ||| delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
0 ||| stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
1 ||| imagine o . henry's <b>the gift of the magi</b> relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc's drug scene . merry friggin' christmas ! 
0 ||| where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
1 ||| all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted . it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face . 
1 ||| as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
1 ||| an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot
1 ||| a perceptive , good-natured movie . 
1 ||| the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
1 ||| oddly compelling . 
1 ||| [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
0 ||| this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
0 ||| the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
0 ||| dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
0 ||| like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
1 ||| brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 
1 ||| the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
0 ||| if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
0 ||| the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
1 ||| a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
1 ||| shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
1 ||| it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
1 ||| amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
0 ||| meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
1 ||| a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . 
1 ||| divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
1 ||| it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
1 ||| a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
0 ||| lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
1 ||| quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perd�o do trocadilho ) , n�o h� como negar o brilhantismo da argumenta��o de seu diretor . 
0 ||| a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
1 ||| the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
1 ||| the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . 
1 ||| daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
0 ||| haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
0 ||| no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
1 |||  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
0 ||| diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
0 ||| piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
0 ||| forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
1 ||| captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
1 ||| the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
1 |||  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
1 ||| the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
1 ||| this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
0 ||| it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
0 ||| if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
0 ||| done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
0 ||| it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
1 ||| an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
0 ||| kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
1 ||| isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
0 |||  . . . really horrible drek . 
1 ||| about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . 
0 ||| it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
1 ||| vera's three actors -- moll� , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
0 ||| most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
1 ||| works because we're never sure if ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks . 
0 ||| it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
1 ||| a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
1 ||| as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
0 ||| the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
1 ||| a stylish thriller . 
0 ||| automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
0 ||| a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
1 ||| don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
1 ||| the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
0 |||  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
1 ||| with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
1 ||| a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time . 
1 ||| oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
1 ||| i've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . 
0 ||| human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
1 ||| the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
0 ||| for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
1 ||| a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
1 ||| sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
0 ||| welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
1 ||| an intelligent , moving and invigorating film . 
0 ||| if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
0 ||| in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
1 ||| samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process . 
0 ||| while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
1 ||| the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
0 ||| seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
0 ||| an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
1 ||| true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable . 
1 ||| at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
1 ||| a poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
1 |||  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject � taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
0 ||| it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
1 ||| its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
0 ||| [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
1 ||| a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
0 ||| unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
0 ||| shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
1 ||| halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
1 ||| the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
0 ||| this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
0 ||| with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
0 ||| comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
0 ||| die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
1 ||| yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
0 ||| the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
0 ||| sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
1 ||| once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
0 ||| 'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
0 ||| unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
1 ||| murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
1 ||| the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
1 ||| exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere . 
1 ||| without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 
0 ||| safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
0 ||| with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
0 ||| passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
0 ||| k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
1 ||| it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
1 ||| if borstal boy isn't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece . 
1 ||| my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
1 ||| it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
0 ||| a complete waste of time . 
0 ||| the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
1 ||| you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
0 ||| the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
0 ||| there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
1 ||| as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
1 ||| a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
1 ||| is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet . 
0 ||| seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
0 ||| just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
0 ||| a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
0 ||| aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
1 ||| humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
0 ||| sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
1 ||| this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
0 ||| the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
1 ||| at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
1 ||| a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
1 ||| the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 
0 ||| like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
1 ||| it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
0 ||| it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
1 ||| as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
1 ||| this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
1 ||| what begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters . 
1 ||| the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 . 
1 ||| a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
0 ||| while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
1 ||| but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
1 ||| even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
0 ||| sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
1 ||| there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
1 ||| a fascinating and fun film . 
1 ||| superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
0 ||| it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock . 
1 ||| hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
1 ||| zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 
1 ||| a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion . 
1 ||| would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
1 ||| but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
0 ||| a chiller resolutely without chills . 
1 ||| meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
1 ||| this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
0 ||| it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
1 ||| the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer . 
0 ||| the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
1 ||| funny in a sick , twisted sort of way . 
1 ||| critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps . 
0 ||| just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
1 ||| you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions . 
0 ||| who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
1 ||| heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 
1 ||| ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled . 
1 ||| a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
1 ||| not a bad journey at all . 
1 ||| has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
0 ||| you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
0 ||| a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
1 |||  . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
0 ||| a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
1 ||| the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
1 ||| probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . 
0 ||| while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
1 ||| the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
0 ||| long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
1 ||| an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
1 ||| the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
1 ||| not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . 
0 ||| birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
0 ||| it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
1 ||| dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
1 ||| the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film . 
0 ||| an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
0 ||| soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
0 ||| a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
0 ||| the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
1 ||| you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
1 ||| a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
0 ||| the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
1 ||| familiar but utterly delightful . 
1 ||| an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
1 ||| transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
0 ||| a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
0 |||  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
0 ||| the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
0 ||| the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
0 ||| aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
1 ||| the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
0 ||| this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
0 ||| video games are more involving than this mess . 
1 ||| a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002's first great film
0 ||| a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
0 ||| another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
0 ||| apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
0 ||| it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
0 ||| i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
0 ||| it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
0 ||| a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
0 ||| the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
0 ||| i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
1 ||| brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
1 ||| an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
0 ||| irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
0 ||| another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
1 ||| i liked this film a lot . . . 
0 ||| stale , futile scenario . 
1 ||| unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
1 ||| a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
1 ||| this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
1 ||| provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
0 ||| i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
1 ||| director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
0 ||| it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
1 ||| this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
1 ||| huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women's augustine . 
1 ||| a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
1 ||| [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
1 ||| a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass . 
1 ||| for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
1 ||| baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
0 ||| less than fresh . 
0 ||| skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
1 ||| neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
1 ||| a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
1 ||| bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
0 ||| ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
0 ||| i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
1 ||| one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
0 ||| ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
1 ||| lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
1 ||| it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
0 ||| [denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
1 ||| hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
1 ||| a wry , affectionate delight . 
0 ||| an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
1 ||| one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
0 |||  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
0 ||| i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
1 ||| beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
1 ||| saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 
1 ||| director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage . 
0 ||| the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
0 ||| with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
1 ||| proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 
0 ||| perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
1 ||| as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
1 ||| the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
1 ||| lejos del para�so es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o�dos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
1 ||| while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
1 ||| has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
1 ||| i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man . 
0 ||| the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
0 ||| there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
1 ||| the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
0 ||| ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
1 ||| singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs � a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story � but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
0 ||| includes too much obvious padding . 
0 ||| a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
1 |||  . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 
0 ||| for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
0 |||  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
0 ||| a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
0 ||| by-the-numbers yarn . 
0 ||| mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
1 ||| ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
1 ||| a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
0 |||  . . . unbearably lame . 
1 ||| the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
0 ||| the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
1 ||| crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
0 ||| while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
1 ||| the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
1 ||| a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
0 ||| offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
0 ||| never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
0 ||| star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
1 ||| a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
0 ||| 'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
1 ||| this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
1 ||| not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . 
0 ||| off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
1 ||| the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
0 ||| a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
0 ||| a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
0 ||| truly terrible . 
1 ||| we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
0 ||| as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
0 ||| secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
1 ||| 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
1 ||| what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
1 ||| more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
1 ||| with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
1 ||| family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking . 
0 ||| build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
0 ||| mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
0 ||| a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
1 |||  " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
1 ||| filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
1 ||| this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
1 ||| the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on b�ttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
1 ||| manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
0 ||| needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
1 ||| while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
1 ||| you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
0 ||| the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
0 ||| falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
1 ||| with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives . 
0 ||| 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
0 ||| while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
1 ||| renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
1 ||| daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
0 ||| when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
0 ||| [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
0 ||| the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
0 ||| it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
0 ||| no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
0 |||  . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
0 ||| formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
1 ||| melodrama with a message . 
0 ||| the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
0 ||| �its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
1 ||| top-notch action powers this romantic drama . 
1 ||| its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 
1 ||| while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging . 
1 ||| leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
0 ||| moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
0 |||  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
1 ||| like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
1 ||| a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
1 ||| a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member . 
0 ||| meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
1 ||| uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
0 ||| there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
0 ||| sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
1 ||| the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended . 
1 ||| nettelbeck . . . has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
1 ||| kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
1 ||| the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
0 ||| the story has little wit and no surprises . 
1 ||| the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
0 ||| without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
0 ||| the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
0 ||| devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
1 ||| this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is . 
0 ||| the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
1 ||| a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
0 ||| nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
1 ||| the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
0 ||| pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
1 ||| the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny . 
1 ||| the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
0 ||| the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
1 ||| a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
1 ||| a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
1 ||| i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
1 ||| a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . 
1 ||| a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
1 ||| nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
0 ||| to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
1 ||| it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
1 ||| combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . 
0 ||| the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
0 ||| oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
1 ||| tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
1 ||| 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
1 ||| working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
0 ||| director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
0 ||| a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
1 ||| crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
1 ||| there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country . 
0 ||| the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
0 ||| a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
0 ||| verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
1 ||| i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
0 ||| when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
1 ||| instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
0 ||| what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
1 ||| at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
1 ||| more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
0 ||| [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
0 ||| almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
1 ||| an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
0 ||| a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
0 ||| a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
0 ||| this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
0 ||| la de salma es una versi�n de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ning�n contenido . 
0 ||| the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
0 ||| perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
0 ||| dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
0 ||| the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
1 ||| it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
0 ||| [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
0 ||| oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
1 ||| gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff . 
1 ||| robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
1 ||| hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
0 ||| the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
1 ||| beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
0 ||| a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
0 ||| a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
0 ||| the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
0 ||| for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
1 ||| this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
1 ||| informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms . 
0 ||| there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
1 ||| a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
0 ||| a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
0 ||| amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
1 ||| the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
0 ||| a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
1 ||| [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
1 ||| an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood . 
1 ||| compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
0 ||| if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
1 ||| the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
1 ||| this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
0 ||| entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
1 |||  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
1 ||| astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one . 
1 ||| despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
0 ||| a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
1 ||| watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision . 
0 ||| it drowns in sap . 
1 ||| makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
1 ||| notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
0 ||| seems like someone going through the motions . 
0 ||| one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
1 ||| narc may not get an 'a' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor . 
0 ||| despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
1 ||| the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
1 ||| this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
0 ||| opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
1 ||| a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
0 ||| you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
1 ||| writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
1 |||  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
0 ||| [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
0 ||| i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
0 ||| goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
1 ||| a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
0 ||| imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma . 
1 ||| working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . 
0 ||| a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
0 ||| to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
0 ||| [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
0 ||| it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
0 ||| a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
0 ||| skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
0 ||| a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
1 ||| the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
1 ||| in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
0 ||| fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
1 ||| daring and beautifully made . 
1 ||| goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse . 
1 ||| the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . 
1 ||| a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
0 ||| a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
0 ||| what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
0 ||| the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
1 ||| it's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
0 ||| while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
0 ||| what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
1 ||| [breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
1 ||| an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up . 
0 ||| belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
1 ||| a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . 
0 ||| cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
0 ||| wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
0 ||| if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
0 ||| death might be a release . 
0 ||| feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
0 ||| it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
0 ||| lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
1 ||| sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
1 ||| thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
1 ||| there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
0 |||  . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
0 ||| es triste tener que decirles que lo �nico grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . . 
1 ||| it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
0 ||| life is a crock -- or something like it . 
0 ||| there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
1 ||| escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
0 ||| viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
0 ||| this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
0 ||| suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
0 ||| rather less than the sum of its underventilated p�re-fils confrontations . 
1 ||| based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
1 ||| your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film . 
0 ||| the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
0 ||| the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
1 ||| at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
0 ||| pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
1 ||| as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
1 ||| one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin . 
0 ||| don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
0 |||  . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
0 ||| we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
1 ||| achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium . 
0 ||| [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
1 ||| i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
0 ||| green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
1 ||| visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
1 ||| it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
1 ||| the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
0 ||| a major waste . . . generic . 
0 ||| you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
0 ||| it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
1 ||| you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
1 ||| a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
1 ||| a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . 
0 ||| thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
0 ||| the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
0 ||| we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
1 ||| a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
1 ||| films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it doesn't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received . 
1 ||| it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
1 ||| the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
1 ||| exciting documentary . 
1 ||| as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
1 ||| there's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us . 
0 ||| everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
1 ||| a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a 'bad' police shooting . 
1 ||| with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
1 ||| a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
0 ||| whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
0 ||| it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
1 ||| knows how to make our imagination wonder . 
0 ||| the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
0 ||| long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
1 ||| a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
0 ||| one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
0 ||| directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
1 ||| the delicious trimmings�arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute�with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
1 ||| as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
1 ||| the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
0 ||| just not campy enough
0 ||| without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstr�m is just another winter sleepers . 
1 ||| a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
0 ||| some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
0 ||| resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
0 ||| as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
0 ||| we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
0 ||| it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
1 ||| a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing . 
1 ||| everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
1 ||| despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
0 ||| the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
0 ||| a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
0 ||| make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
1 ||| [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
1 ||| sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
0 ||| the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
1 ||| the film is one of the year's best . 
1 ||| no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
0 ||| limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
0 ||| birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honor� ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
0 ||| got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
0 ||| hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
1 ||| a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
1 ||| bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
1 ||| if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
0 ||| it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
1 ||| you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
1 ||| fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
1 ||| mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
1 ||| what i saw , i enjoyed . 
0 ||| when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
0 ||| the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
0 ||| it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
1 ||| davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
0 ||| it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the filmit was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
1 ||| a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
1 ||| despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
1 ||| the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree . 
1 ||| ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
0 ||| despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
1 ||| the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
0 ||| it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
0 ||| a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
1 ||| the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
0 ||| the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
1 ||| aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
0 ||| the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
0 ||| imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
1 ||| there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
1 ||| haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
0 ||| a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
0 ||| a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
1 ||| those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
1 ||| this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
0 ||| it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
0 ||| often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
1 ||| even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
1 ||| a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . 
0 ||| the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
1 ||| a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
1 ||| a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a �direct-to-video' release . 
1 ||| an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
0 ||| scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
1 ||| deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
1 ||| must be seen to be believed . 
0 ||| the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
1 ||| kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
0 ||| watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
1 ||| a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
1 ||| if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
0 ||| becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
0 ||| clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
0 ||| kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
0 ||| the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
1 ||| fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
1 ||| payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
1 ||| changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
0 ||| writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
0 ||| the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
1 ||| what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
0 ||| credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
0 ||| an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
1 ||| the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
0 ||| a grating , emaciated flick . 
0 ||| unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
1 |||  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
0 ||| has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
0 ||| rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
1 ||| kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
0 ||| ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
0 ||| this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
0 ||| it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
0 ||| in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
0 ||| [at least] moore is a real charmer . 
1 ||| as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
0 ||| murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
0 ||| this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
0 ||| solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
0 ||| lacks depth . 
0 |||  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
0 ||| a big fat pain . 
1 ||| it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
0 ||| queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
1 ||| rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language . 
0 ||| i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
0 ||| it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
0 ||| wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
0 ||| there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
1 ||| for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
0 ||| a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
0 ||| gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
1 ||| a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession . 
0 ||| leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . 
0 ||| ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
1 ||| clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie . 
0 ||| just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
0 ||| dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
0 ||| can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
1 ||| hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
0 |||  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
1 ||| expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women . 
1 ||| the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 
1 ||| what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
1 ||| where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
0 ||| anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
0 ||| given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
0 ||| unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
1 ||| take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year . 
0 |||  . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
0 ||| there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
0 ||| the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
1 ||| throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
0 ||| once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
1 ||| wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
0 ||| it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
1 ||| tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances . 
1 ||| a very funny movie . 
1 ||| the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 
1 ||| this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
1 ||| baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
1 |||  . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations . 
1 ||| there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
0 ||| directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
1 ||| the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
1 ||| an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
0 ||| illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
0 ||| neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
1 ||| it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
1 ||| as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
0 ||| if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
1 ||| writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
0 ||| the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
1 ||| one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
1 ||| all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
1 ||| occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
1 ||| there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
0 ||| there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
1 ||| in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
1 ||| even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
1 ||| like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
0 ||| [t]he film is never sure to make a clear point even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
0 ||| absurdities and clich�s accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
1 ||| for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
1 ||| gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film . 
1 ||| a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
0 ||| a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
0 ||| one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
0 ||| loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
1 ||| rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
1 ||| it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
0 ||| crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
0 ||| a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
1 ||| this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer . 
1 ||| famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the clich�-riddled genre can offer . 
1 ||| each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments . 
0 ||| watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
1 ||| takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
1 ||| stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
0 ||| the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
0 ||| the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
1 ||| great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
1 ||| bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time . 
0 ||| nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
1 ||| filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
0 ||| it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
1 ||| combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
0 ||| if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
1 ||| elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
1 ||| imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
1 ||| otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
0 ||| brisk hack job . 
1 ||| earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
1 ||| one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
0 ||| a ragbag of cliches . 
0 ||| donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
1 ||| upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
1 ||| an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
0 ||| '[hopkins]doesn't so much phone in his performance as fax it . no , even that's too committed . he gets his secretary to fax it . " 
1 ||| all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
0 ||| cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
0 ||| ararat feels like a book report
0 ||| sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
1 ||| i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
1 ||| a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama . 
1 ||| about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
0 ||| the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
1 ||| what a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 
1 ||| spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
0 ||| an encouraging effort from mccrudden
0 ||| the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
0 ||| the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
0 ||| if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
1 ||| despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
0 ||| if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and clich� . 
1 ||| for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
1 ||| you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
0 ||| exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
1 ||| at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . 
1 ||| daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story
1 ||| quietly engaging . 
1 ||| a modestly surprising movie . 
1 ||| a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy . 
0 ||| succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
1 ||| foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
0 ||| on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
1 ||| sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
0 ||| nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0 ||| the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
0 ||| the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
1 ||| playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
1 ||| quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
0 ||| the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
1 ||| this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
0 ||| a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
1 ||| on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
0 ||| britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
0 ||| spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
1 ||| director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
0 ||| curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
0 ||| not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
0 ||| well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
1 ||| old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . 
0 ||| an intriguing near-miss . 
0 ||| overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
1 ||| an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
0 ||| it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
0 ||| the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
0 ||| pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
1 ||| greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
0 |||  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
1 ||| schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
1 ||| a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
1 ||| a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
0 ||| a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
0 ||| o �timo esfor�o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos s�o explicados . 
1 ||| the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
1 ||| a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
0 ||| this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
1 ||| a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
0 ||| as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
0 ||| the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
1 ||| michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he's got as potent a topic as ever here . 
1 ||| an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
0 ||| a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
1 ||| a lovely and beautifully photographed romance . 
1 ||| a stirring road movie . 
1 ||| culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 
0 ||| so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
1 ||| eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents . 
0 ||| warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
0 ||| wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
1 ||| the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . 
0 ||| the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
0 ||| it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
0 ||| as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
1 ||| this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
0 ||| while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
1 ||| doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
1 ||| niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
1 ||| the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour . 
0 ||| despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
0 ||| it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
0 ||| the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
0 ||| statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
0 ||| essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
1 ||| a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
0 ||| the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
1 ||| it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
1 ||| director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
1 ||| the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
1 ||| like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
1 ||| an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
1 ||| for all its serious sense of purpose . . . [it] finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor . 
1 ||| another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better . 
0 ||| [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
0 ||| there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
1 ||| it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
1 ||| a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
1 ||| the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
0 ||| this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
0 ||| a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
1 ||| uno de los policiales m�s interesantes de los �ltimos tiempos . 
0 ||| even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
1 ||| noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective . 
0 ||| for dance completists only . 
0 |||  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
1 ||| its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
0 ||| if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
1 ||| if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
0 ||| too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
1 ||| though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
0 ||| draggin' about dragons
1 ||| exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
0 ||| everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
1 ||| hardly a film that comes along every day . 
0 ||| while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
0 ||| shrewd but pointless . 
1 ||| although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
0 ||| works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
1 ||| leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
0 ||| unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
1 ||| i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
0 ||| there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
0 ||| family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
0 ||| i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
1 ||| a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
1 ||| it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
0 ||| the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
1 ||| for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller . 
0 ||| enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
0 ||| this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
1 ||| tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
0 ||| unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
1 ||| what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
0 ||| not even the hanson brothers can save it
0 ||| too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
0 ||| the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
1 ||| having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
0 ||| all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
1 ||| sleek and arty . 
1 ||| we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . 
0 ||| the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
0 ||| the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
0 ||| freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
0 ||| these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
1 ||| an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . 
1 ||| we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
1 ||| it's a charming and often affecting journey . 
1 ||| for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
0 ||| a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
0 ||| the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
1 ||| the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right . 
0 ||| any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
1 ||| it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
0 ||| admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
0 ||| the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
0 ||| press the delete key . 
0 ||| hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
1 ||| this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s . 
1 ||| seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . 
1 ||| what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . 
0 ||| one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
0 ||| what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
1 ||| witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
1 ||| a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
1 ||| 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
0 ||| the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
0 ||| there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
0 ||| the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
0 ||| basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
0 ||| earnest but heavy-handed . 
1 ||| a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
1 |||  " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
1 ||| the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
1 ||| so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
1 ||| moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 
1 ||| this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
0 ||| about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
1 ||| douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
1 ||| harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
1 ||| pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
0 ||| snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
0 ||| criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
0 ||| contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
0 ||| this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
1 ||| a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
1 ||| with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
1 ||| a moving , if uneven , success . 
0 ||| mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
1 ||| nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . 
0 ||| cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
1 ||| a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid . 
1 ||| medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
1 ||| you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 
0 ||| pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
0 ||| the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
0 ||| bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
1 ||| the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
0 ||| screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
0 ||| forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
0 ||| diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
1 ||| nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood .

0 ||| most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
1 ||| polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ? 
0 ||| divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
0 ||| a pretentious mess . 
0 ||| not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
1 ||| a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors . 
1 ||| it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
0 ||| rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
1 ||| the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .

1 |||  . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around )

0 ||| as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
1 ||| a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
0 ||| never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
1 ||| a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
1 ||| a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
1 ||| it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
1 ||| nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
0 ||| a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .

1 ||| holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
1 ||| paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
1 ||| twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
0 ||| this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .

1 ||| a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities .

0 ||| the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
0 ||| this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away .

0 ||| dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
0 ||| the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
1 ||| nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
1 ||| exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
0 ||| a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
0 ||| van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
1 ||| walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 
1 ||| beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .

1 ||| from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .

1 ||| a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
1 ||| neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
1 ||| unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
0 ||| by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
0 ||| it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
0 ||| on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
1 ||| a film of quiet power . 
1 ||| williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
1 ||| fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
1 ||| it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
0 ||| while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
1 ||| claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
1 ||| it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
1 ||| the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off . 
0 ||| any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
0 ||| it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
0 ||| with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
1 ||| if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
0 ||| tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
1 ||| opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
1 ||| overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
1 ||| anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
1 ||| a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
1 ||| the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
1 ||| an extraordinary dramatic experience . 
1 ||| after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
1 ||| for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
1 ||| the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
1 ||| a winning and wildly fascinating work . 
1 ||| the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
0 ||| kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
1 ||| morvern rocks . 
1 |||  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
1 ||| dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
1 ||| parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
0 ||| it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
0 ||| kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
0 ||| the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . 
1 ||| a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
1 ||| hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
1 ||| a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . 
0 ||| a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
1 ||| watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown . 
0 ||| ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
0 ||| for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
0 ||| a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
0 ||| the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
1 ||| there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
0 |||  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
1 ||| has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
0 ||| too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
1 ||| an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
1 ||| a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
0 ||| every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
0 ||| spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
0 ||| the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
0 ||| i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
0 ||| the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
1 ||| a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers . 
1 ||| a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
1 ||| this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
1 ||| the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
1 ||| suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . 
0 ||| what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
1 ||| this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion . 
0 ||| ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
0 ||| while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
1 ||| the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 
0 ||| if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
0 ||| it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
1 ||| henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
0 ||| despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
0 ||| apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
0 ||| though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
0 ||| the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
1 ||| a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
0 ||| summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
0 ||| as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
0 ||| makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
1 ||| films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
1 ||| the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
0 ||| it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
1 ||| a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense . 
1 ||| hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
1 ||| i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
0 ||| flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
1 ||| like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
0 ||| reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
1 ||| this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
1 ||| it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
0 ||| the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
0 ||| everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
1 ||| too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . " 
0 ||| the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
0 ||| demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
1 ||| there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
0 ||| sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
0 ||| the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
1 ||| engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 
0 ||| a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
0 ||| never comes together as a coherent whole . 
0 ||| the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
0 ||| obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
0 ||| opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
0 ||| the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
1 ||| affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things . 
1 ||| pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
1 ||| it's a treat � a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score� grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
0 ||| cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
1 ||| genuinely unnerving . 
1 |||  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
0 ||| could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
1 ||| filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
0 ||| the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
0 ||| at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
1 ||| the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
0 ||| the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
0 ||| on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
1 ||| call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
0 ||| i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
1 |||  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
0 ||| with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
1 ||| plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
0 ||| the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
0 ||| it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
1 ||| what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
1 ||| the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
1 ||| the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
0 ||| were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
0 ||| it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
0 ||| might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
0 ||| terminally brain dead production . 
1 ||| a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
0 ||| what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
1 ||| this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
0 ||| sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
1 ||| the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
0 |||  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
0 ||| woefully pretentious . 
1 ||| remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
1 ||| as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
1 ||| creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
1 ||| this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
0 ||| too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
0 ||| despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
0 ||| lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
0 ||| its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
0 ||| when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
0 ||| there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
0 ||| a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
0 ||| despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
1 ||| as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
1 ||| karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
1 ||| boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
0 ||| how do you spell clich� ? 
1 ||| the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
1 ||| although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
0 ||| a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
0 ||| it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
1 ||| told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings . 
0 ||| the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
1 ||| if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .
