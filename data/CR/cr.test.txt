0 ||| regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
1 ||| we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .
0 ||| to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .
1 ||| the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
0 ||| the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
1 ||| it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
0 ||| during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .
1 ||| as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .
1 ||| i like the speed control .
0 ||| another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]
1 ||| i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
0 ||| finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
1 ||| it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .
0 ||| it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
0 ||| the door would not close .
0 ||| a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .
1 ||| very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .
0 ||| the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue .
1 ||| but the product is elf is great .
1 ||| the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .
0 ||| to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
1 ||| first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .
0 ||| my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
1 ||| playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
1 ||| pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .
1 ||| songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .
0 ||| it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
0 ||| but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function .
0 ||| however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) .
1 ||| the fm radio is cool .
0 ||| my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
1 ||| 3 . bags are easy to change .
0 ||| the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
1 ||| 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
1 ||| good looks
1 ||| noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
0 ||| i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .
0 ||| no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .
1 ||| there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
0 ||| ( . . . ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non-existant logging .
0 ||| 00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .
0 ||| i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the " sliding wrench " which comes on the router .
1 ||| it looks great - and is loaded with features .
0 ||| the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
1 ||| the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .
1 ||| overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .
1 ||| the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .
1 ||| 1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .
1 ||| i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .
1 ||| this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
0 ||| it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
0 ||| the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
1 ||| the phone itself is pretty nice .
1 ||| after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .
1 ||| the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
1 ||| everything shines of quality .
0 ||| my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .
1 ||| finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
1 ||| the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
0 ||| the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned .
1 ||| well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! . ! .
0 ||| unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .
0 ||| ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
0 ||| the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
0 ||| the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
0 ||| i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .
1 ||| it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .
1 ||| i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
0 ||| the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
1 ||| i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .
1 ||| it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .
0 ||| there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .
1 ||| i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
1 ||| i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .
1 ||| my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
0 ||| in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless .
1 ||| the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .
1 ||| the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .
1 ||| with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .
1 ||| the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
1 ||| i have never had an odor problem ! .
1 ||| i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .
1 ||| this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
1 ||| the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .
1 ||| software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
1 ||| i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .
1 ||| the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .
1 ||| we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .
1 ||| in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .
0 ||| and the battery life is bad ! .
1 ||| picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .
0 ||| 3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .
1 ||| long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod ! .
0 ||| the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
1 ||| great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .
1 ||| 5 . the price is right .
0 ||| the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .
1 ||| if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! .
0 ||| opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .
1 ||| it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
1 ||| another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .
1 ||| using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .
1 ||| the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server .
1 ||| audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions .
1 ||| i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .
1 ||| now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .
0 ||| i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .
0 ||| on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
1 ||| even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .
0 ||| the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .
0 ||| it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
1 ||| but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .
0 ||| back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .
0 ||| do n 't buy this player .
1 ||| the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
0 ||| stay away from this junk .
1 ||| people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
0 ||| i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .
0 ||| i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .
0 ||| if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .
1 ||| you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
1 ||| c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
0 ||| again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .
1 ||| i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .
1 ||| other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .
1 ||| and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .
1 ||| creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .
1 ||| the height adjustment works well- not perfect .
1 ||| recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
1 ||| those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
0 ||| after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
0 ||| although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
1 ||| the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
1 ||| i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .
1 ||| i love the es based controls and easy menus .
1 ||| moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .
1 ||| in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
0 ||| it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
0 ||| i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .
0 ||| video output stopped working .
0 ||| the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .
0 ||| if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .
1 ||| i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .
1 ||| and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
0 ||| the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
1 ||| the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
1 ||| this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
1 ||| update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! .
1 ||| i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .
1 ||| but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
1 ||| its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .
1 ||| i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
1 ||| the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
1 ||| i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .
1 ||| the player is great .
0 ||| the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
1 ||| it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .
1 ||| the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
0 ||| there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .
1 ||| 1 ) price / gb of storage
0 ||| ) creative , inc . the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices .
0 ||| it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
1 ||| the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )
1 ||| no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! .
1 ||| it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .
0 ||| also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .
1 ||| my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not " whine " during video , and my pictures are razor sharp .
0 ||| my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
1 ||| built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .
1 ||| if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .
0 ||| the customer support is pathetic .
1 ||| i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
0 ||| i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
1 ||| all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
0 ||| it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
1 ||| having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .
1 ||| the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
1 ||| overall , this product is awesome .
0 ||| 2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
1 ||| i am very pleased with it so far .
1 ||| i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
0 ||| every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
1 ||| i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .
1 ||| have a great and easy to use bundled software
1 ||| no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .
0 ||| last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this .
1 ||| i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
1 ||| there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
0 ||| basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .
1 ||| hate to wait between shots
1 ||| you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .
0 ||| this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
0 ||| a bit disappoint on that ! .
1 ||| if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
1 ||| with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .
1 ||| i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )
1 ||| it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
0 ||| so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .
1 ||| the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
1 ||| i really love this phone . . .
1 ||| i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .
1 ||| i purchased two of these beauties .
1 ||| no vibration ! .
0 ||| some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name " the bar of soap " which , it really is .
0 ||| although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
1 ||| i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
0 ||| i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
1 ||| - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
1 ||| what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
1 ||| solid , squeak-free , large screen .
1 ||| i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .
1 ||| the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
1 ||| best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
0 ||| the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .
1 ||| i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
0 ||| -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
1 ||| i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .
1 ||| the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control .
1 ||| 5- excelent software package .
1 ||| really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .
1 ||| i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
1 ||| i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .
1 ||| the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
1 ||| the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .
0 ||| 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
0 ||| apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
1 ||| with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
0 ||| got way too many blurry pictures .
1 ||| this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
1 ||| i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; . and i needed to be able to use wma files .
1 ||| i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .
0 ||| respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .
0 ||| what a junk .
0 ||| if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .
1 ||| 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
0 ||| start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .
1 ||| i love all of the features , and presets as well .
1 ||| 7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .
0 ||| the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
1 ||| i have to say that i am very happy with it so far .
1 ||| other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
1 ||| the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .
0 ||| in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
0 ||| the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
1 ||| i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
1 ||| great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
1 ||| despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .
1 ||| the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
0 ||| this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
1 ||| your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .
1 ||| i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
0 ||| the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .
1 ||| the battery life on this phone is surreal .
1 ||| since then , i have not found one major problem with it .
1 ||| it 's a very intuitive program .
1 ||| personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .
1 ||| no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .
1 ||| i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
0 ||| the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
1 ||| putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
1 ||| 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
1 ||| the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
1 ||| very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .
0 ||| the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken .
0 ||| one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
1 ||| the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .
1 ||| the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
1 ||| but for what i do use it is perfect .
1 ||| also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .
1 ||| it works great .
0 ||| it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .
1 ||| sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .
0 ||| even the instruction booklet is out of order .
0 ||| the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
1 ||| cuts are easy and smooth .
1 ||| all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
0 ||| the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .
0 ||| my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .
1 ||| from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .
1 ||| it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
0 ||| it 's not my first choice in cameras ,
0 ||| 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; . it does not charge by usb cable ; . this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
0 ||| but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .
1 ||| i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .
1 ||| many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
1 ||| ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .
1 ||| i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
0 ||| this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! .
0 ||| unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .
1 ||| the price compared to the ipod is great .
1 ||| mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .
1 ||| i got it working fast enough .
1 ||| have had the player since xmas's and love it ! .
0 ||| the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust .
1 ||| the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
1 ||| not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
1 ||| the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .
1 ||| it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
1 ||| while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .
0 ||| only then did i learn the truth -- this phone does not work with palm pdas ! .
1 ||| simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
1 ||| works great , no odor , and uses regular bags .
1 ||| great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .
0 ||| third , the poor design continues with the case .
0 ||| especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
1 ||| it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .
1 ||| i like the automatic key lock function .
0 ||| it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
1 ||| this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .
1 ||| the camera was a marvel .
1 ||| the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .
1 ||| the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
1 ||| i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .
1 ||| it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .
1 ||| i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
1 ||| all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
0 ||| even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .
1 ||| 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
0 ||| 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
1 ||| in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
1 ||| i love this player .
1 ||| this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .
0 ||| quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
1 ||| nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
1 ||| we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .
0 ||| the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .
1 ||| downloads are a snap and quick .
1 ||| comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .
0 ||| imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .
1 ||| and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags -- -this takes ordinary garbage bags ! .
1 ||| actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .
1 ||| it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .
0 ||| the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
1 ||| it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .
1 ||| the good : 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution .
1 ||| you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .
1 ||| it is an extremely cool cozmo .
1 ||| hold button -- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; . this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .
0 ||| at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
1 ||| on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .
1 ||| ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .
1 ||| i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
1 ||| this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .
1 ||| i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
1 ||| the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .
1 ||| its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .
1 ||| my experience with installation was quite good .
0 ||| a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go . . the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .
1 ||| it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .
0 ||| the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
1 ||| this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
1 ||| mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .
0 ||| i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
1 ||| frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .
1 ||| the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
1 ||| one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .
0 ||| the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
1 ||| saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $25 . 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .
1 ||| by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .
1 ||| drops and strong signals even from the backyard .
0 ||| it also does n 't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! . ! .
1 ||| it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .
0 ||| it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .
1 ||| seriously ! . i love it ! .
1 ||| the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .
1 ||| speed is not a problem .
1 ||| i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .
1 ||| i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
1 ||| so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read .
1 ||| the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .
1 ||| but canon never fails to amaze .
1 ||| anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .
